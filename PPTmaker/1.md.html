# Game Mechanics

## Game Mechanics: Magic System

* Use different elements to cast different magics.
* Various ways to combine elements: the seq, the number of different elements, the hand you use, etc.
* Magic from different players can also interact with each other.
* Support magic included. Encourage co-op in multi-player (>2) games.

## Game Mechanics: Interaction with Objects

* Throw a giant stone in map to your op seems cooooool.
* Objects also interact with elements.

## Game Mechanics: Players

* No MP limits.
* Can equip weapons: different weapons enhance different elements/offer special skills.
* No difference in basic attributes.
* (Somehow using a melee weapon is cool, so we decided to enable close fights).
* Winner in a game get new equipments into is connection.
* Choose different equipment in different scene: (Eg: magic 300% more powerful but casted at only 50% speed).
