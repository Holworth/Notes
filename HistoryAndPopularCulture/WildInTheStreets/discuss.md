Hi everyone,

I would like to talk about my idea for that movie.

What is important about this movie is that it is a low-budget film. It means it aims to attract the young audience by using the element and ideas the young like. So what are in the the movie reflect the young people's interest and the young people's idea at that time: Rock music, LSD and luxury life. The young people are not satisfied with the government and the older generation so they go out for procession. Young people feel constrained of the suburban life, so as Maxin the movie does, the young try to rebel their parents and flee from their daily life in suburban.

Because it is just a low-budget movie, so it does not want to answer the question that what can the young people do to fit into the world. We can see the end of this movie is also a "political right" end: the "Max US" is a crazy place and then challenged by younger people. This is the movie's answer: by just rocking, taking LSD and crying for more rights, the young people can not make the country better.

Another interesting about this movie is the slogan "14 or fight", it do reflected the American young people calling for more political rights. This may related to the fact that an American may be sent to Vietnam at 18, but he is not able to vote for the war until he is 21. "14 or fight" is a reflection of the calling for change the vote age to 18 (26th Amendment in 1972) and the rising tide of student movement.

In fact, the movie itself is just like LSD: an absurd story, an violent hybridity of many things liked by the young people, a magical realism world. It is a cheap and fast enjoyment for the young to flee from the reality for a while, but after that, just like Max have to face the problem the younger people is going to challenge him, the audience have to go back to reality.
