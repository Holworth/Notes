Re: ONG YU QI 

Hello everyone!

I would like to share some idea about the questions just mentioned.

About the question: "what are your thoughts on the bicycle salesman disrupting the sheriff?", I think COLEMAN REBECCA LAUREN and ONG YU QI gives two different views to answer this question: that scene can be seen as a reflection to the consumerism thoughts in 1960s, or the anti-war thoughts. Personally I like LAUREN's idea better. For in this movie, people in the town choose to stay silent while the sheriff is talking, and their views were soon captured by the salesman who was trying to sell a bike. When people in 1960s realized the war they were in may not be a "right war", they turn to stood out, organized gatherings and processions against war. However, the people in this movie chose to be silent when the sheriff is talking. So maybe, consumerism affairs, just like the salesman and the bike, was taking peoples attentions from what really matters, like the tow robbers in this movie, is what the movie trying to convey.

As for romanticisation of the cowboys' life, I can not agree more with REBECCA's idea.

Both the idea "where the duo represent the American government", and "the movie was just a reflection of the hope Americans have, for someone to step in and rise up against the government" are quite refreshing ideas, yet I am not sure if it is the movie trying to convey, or we just over-interpreted the movie?
