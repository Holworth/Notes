Red redemption 2: what does it reflect. -->

Hello everyone,

It seems it is a little bit late to join the discussion, so as the last one to join the forum, I will try to recap what I think is important according to the discussion above.

To be honest, this movie did not touch me at the first time. When watching From the Earth to the Moon last week, I was really excited, though it is only a documentary. To look for the result, I would like to say that I was impressed by the nobel spirit who is willing to sacrifice themselves to widen the boundary of human beings. However, in this movie, such non-hero protagonists like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are quite common in popular culture nowadays, and it is not fresh to modern audiences.

Yet from your discussions, I have noticed several worth mentioning things of this movie. The first thing is that, this movie reflects the turbulent social status. It does not focus on traditional Cowboys, but two so-called anti-social robbers, which is a significant turning point in 
western films. Considering this movie was a great success in the U.S., it is reasonable to say that the movie suited and reflected the thought wave in 1960s: American people start to questioning about the long-considered-right social values and try to make change. In same ways it annotated the era
 of anti-institutional thoughts, in which civil rights movement and the hipple movement were prevalent among young people.

The second worth-thinking idea is about Etta. I really like the idea from MUHAMMAD S. B. Sapiee: Etta is a female who knows what she want and will put her thought into real action. She was not constrained int the role as a teacher, but chose to set on the journey with two (handsome) robbers. We can see the character of Etta as a incarnation of females in the Women’s Liberation Movement.

The last thing I want to discuss about is the section of the sheriff and the salesman. Personally, I agree with the idea that this scene reflects the consumerism thoughts and try to arise audiences attention: when people all focus on consumer goods like bikes instead of the society, will the society still develop healthily?

Besides these ideas from the movie which reflects the 1960s' American society, I would like to ask another question: as the characters in this movie reflects conflicts in 1960s American society, what is the cowboys character now? What can we imply from it about the American's society now?  

<!-- An instance is the game Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2018. As a new media of popular culture, games are usually considered not as serious as movies. Yet Red Dead Redemption 2 succeed  -->

An instance is the video game "Red Dead Redemption 2" (2018). This game, which tells a story about a gang at the end of cowboy's era, is a great success in 2018 and a remarkable consistent of pop culture of that year. Though it is not related with our course's topic about the 1960s America, I think it is still an interesting question to think about.

(PS: If you have enough time, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game you won't want to miss.)
