The core thing we can learn from *the Green Berets* and *the MASH* is the what are the American's attitudes towards the war. Based on these different attitudes, we can learn more about complexities of the American experience in Vietnam in other aspects.

What *the Green Berets* does is to gives reasons for the Vietnam War. It represents those Americans support for the war. Reasons it gives are listed as following:

1. Ideology War: As shown at the beginning of this movie, while answering the journalist's questions, the troops showed the items they seize at war to prove that the Communism countries were supporting this war, and it is the first reason this movie provided for this war.

2. To fight against the brutal communism government: In this movie, the north Vietnam government is described as a brutal and corrupt government. We can see in the movie that the north Vietnam general lives a luxurious life, planed the raid to the camp and ordered the assassination of uncooperative government officers. The north Vietnam troops killed the village head who contacted the U.S. army, and driven civilians as their cover in the raid to the camp. By showing this movie suggests that the U.S. is helping to fight against an evil regime.

3. To help the local people to live a better life: The U.S. army in this movie offered medical help to the villagers and also offered shelter to the villagers in the camp raid instead of the northern troop *in this movie* who driven these villagers as alive sandbags. At the end of this movie, it also claimed that the purpose of the U.S. troop is to protect civilians kike the boy in the movie.

These war reasons above have been used for many times since World War 2: to fight against an evil government and to protect the local civilians. This movie reflects the ideas of those who support this war: the Vietnam War is for a noble reason and there is no reason to retreat from Vietnam.

What *the MASH* trying to show on the movie is another thing. The MASH in the movie is a place far from the front line battle. Solders here play soccer and make love. The audience can not feel there is a war in progress, excepts from the injured solders sent to the MASH.

Here, *the MASH* reflects another kind of attitude towards war. The truth that characters in the movie do not care about the front line battle reflects some Americans do not care about the war, what they want is just daily life as usual. This kind of attitude towards the war can be called **irrelevant**. During the movie, no reason is given about the war. There are no Greek tragedies about heroes but only farces about ordinary people who were sent to war. By doing so, this movie tries to the decrease the seriousness of war and make people think about the reason for the war.

Meanwhile, *The MASH* also suggested the following ideas:

1. People who are not in the front do not know the cruelty of war.

In both Korean War and Vietnam War, many soldiers died in front line as well as many civilians. As the movie shows, many injured soldiers were sent to the hospital. On the other side, people in the back can not feel the sacrifice in the front line. The MASH in the movie is a place far from the front, no one really cares about the war. People in MASH can hardly feel the pain of war: they just make love and play soccer. It also suggests that the decision-makers (and those who are far away from the war) in real world can not feel the pain of war themselves.

2. People in this war do not know what it is for. They were just driven blindly into this war.

As the people in MASH do in the movie, they do not care about the war. What they do is just dawdling. There is no courage or sacrifice shown in the movie. The characters' actions in the movie are just as naive as playing house.

From these two kinds of different attitudes towards the war, other disagreements in American society show up.

The first disagreement is the reason for the war. As mentioned above, the Americans at that time were arguing about the significance of the war. Since World War 2, the Americans believe that they fight for justice. But the Korean War and the Vietnam War make Americans think if Ideology War is a justice war and the war is worth it. The dispelling of army authority in *Mesh* showed that people were no longer stick to the idea that the war was a war of justice.

The second disagreement is the attitude towards the government and the institutions. American government claimed that the Vietnam War is a Justice War and it is worth it. There were people stand with the U.S. government and support the war, for example, they make movies like *The Green Berets*. There were also people questioning about the correctness of oversea ideology wars. Movies like *MASH* are at the opposite of the authority. They tried to dispel the authority of the government and the army to protest silently.

The third disagreement is about the military service system in the war. During Vietnam War, many Americans were forced to join the army. However, there were also many Americans who tried to escape from military service. The problem is: is dying for a foreign country worth one's own life? There were people support the government and believe those who tried to avoid military service should be punished. *The Green Berets* can be seen as an advertisement for the Army. It tries to convey the idea that the sacrifice in Vietnam is worthy and citizen of proper age should join the army. At the same time, life like *MASH* is what those who tried to avoid military service want. They look forward to living a peaceful life, not to die pointlessly in a foreign country.

In conclusion, the two movies reflect the dissension in America in Vietnam War, especially the dissension between the government and the civilians.
