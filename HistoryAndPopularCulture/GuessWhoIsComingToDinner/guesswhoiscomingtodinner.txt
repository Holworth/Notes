1
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,012
You know,
I just had a thought.

2
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:32,752
Why don't I check in a hotel
and rest.

3
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,948
- You go find your folks.
- Oh, John.

4
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:38,082
You wanted to meet them.
Let's go meet them.

5
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,093
The sooner we get it over with,
the better.

6
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,686
Mom may not even be at the gallery.
She'll probably be out to lunch.

7
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,164
Dad's at his office. You may not
meet them till dinner anyway.

8
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,326
You may be wrong about them.

9
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,961
You should have called
and told them we were coming.

10
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:53,302
You may be in for the biggest shock
of your young life.

11
00:03:53,374 --> 00:03:55,968
After 23 years living
in the same house with them...

12
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:58,443
don't you think I know
my own mother and father?

13
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:00,504
I hope so.

14
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,811
There's no problem.

15
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,756
We'll only be a minute, and then
we'd like to go out to Claremont Drive.

16
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,425
Right.

17
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:29,008
I'll see if Mom's
in the office.

18
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:39,410
- Joey!
- Hilary, hi! How are you?

19
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,149
What a surprise.

20
00:04:42,223 --> 00:04:44,657
- I'll be with you in just a moment.
- Okay.

21
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,661
- Strange.
- One of Hilary's favorites.

22
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:58,432
It's called a kinetic sculpture.

23
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,440
- A what?
- Look.

24
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,345
Why, isn't that something?

25
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,386
- Darling, what are you doing here?
- I thought Mother might be here.

26
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:15,581
Mrs. St. George, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Prentice.

27
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:17,954
Dr. Prentice,
I'm so pleased to meet you.

28
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:20,391
Mrs. St. George.
Pleasure to see you.

29
00:05:21,963 --> 00:05:24,090
Christina's lunching
with Mr. Cazalet.

30
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:25,598
I can ring up.

31
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,896
No. Just tell her I'm back
and that I'll be home.

32
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:32,133
Has something happened?
I mean, is anything wrong?

33
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,800
Something's happened,
but everything's right. Thanks.

34
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,835
How was Hawaii?
Was it fun?

35
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:41,177
Hawaii was simply unbelievable.

36
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:46,511
Do you live in San Francisco, Doctor,
or are you just visiting?

37
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:48,555
- I'm just passing through.
- I see.

38
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:51,114
- It was a pleasure to have met you.
- Thank you.

39
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:52,284
Bye-bye.

40
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,914
No, Hilary runs the gallery now,
but it's Mom who has all the ideas.

41
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:23,150
Her idea for filling hotel rooms
with originals is brilliant.

42
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:26,682
It gives people who stay there
time to decide if they want them.

43
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,695
The hotel gets supplied
with free decor.

44
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,823
The guests get to look at good paintings
instead of bad reproductions.

45
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,335
The painter gets a chance to make a sale
and Mom gets her commission.

46
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:36,495
Next right.

47
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:40,470
- Isn't that clever?
- Oh, that is clever.

48
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,585
- What do I owe you?
- 10.50, mac.

49
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:29,889
Twelve bucks, right?

50
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,893
Right.

51
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,554
Right.

52
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,466
Oh, John.
Come meet Tillie.

53
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,236
Tillie, this is Dr. Prentice.
John, Miss Matilda Binks.

54
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:49,367
Pleased to meet you, Miss Binks.

55
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:52,970
I've certainly heard
a great deal about you.

56
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:54,981
What are you
doing home unexpected?

57
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:57,984
Your folks didn't know you was coming.
You told them you're back already?

58
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:00,247
I left a message for Mom
at the gallery.

59
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,346
It's lovely to see you.
I missed you.

60
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:04,550
You still ain't told me
why you're home early.

61
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,617
- You want those bags to go upstairs?
- Not my two. I'm not staying.

62
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,664
It's personal reasons.
I'll tell you all about it.

63
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:13,757
You eat any lunch yet,
or you expecting it now?

64
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:18,032
Could you make us sandwiches and coffee?
We'll have it on the terrace.

65
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:43,796
Do you like it?

66
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,134
It's beautiful.

67
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:49,294
Come out
and look from the terrace.

68
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,143
- What?
- Hey, who's that?

69
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:06,081
That's Dorothy. Isn't she a knockout?
She helps Tillie during the week.

70
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,587
- Which days?
- Never mind.

71
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,692
You know, I ought to call my folks
and get that out of the way.

72
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,698
Okay. Use the phone in the study.

73
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,792
- Are you gonna introduce me?
- Not on the phone.

74
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:24,235
- Aren't you gonna tell them about me?
- I'd rather write to them.

75
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:27,934
I have to meet them, don't I?
Before I come to Geneva?

76
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:31,910
Or are we going to keep our marriage
a secret from them?

77
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:34,379
Why didn't I think of that?
See, that's a thought.

78
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,418
I'll shut this
in case Dorothy goes by.

79
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:18,414
Los Angeles, please.
Area code 213.

80
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:21,791
Axminster, two, four, six, nine, nine.
Time and charges.

81
00:10:21,862 --> 00:10:24,592
Well, I got a right
to my own opinions.

82
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,428
And you want my opinion?

83
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,901
I don't care to see a member
of my own race getting above hisself.

84
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,599
Then I don't want your opinion,
and if I ever do, I'll ask for it.

85
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,438
Oh, Tillie, I'm sorry.

86
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,241
I didn't mean that, but you can't mean
what you're saying either.

87
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:42,612
And you're so wrong.
Look.

88
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:47,780
You're the last person I'd have expected
to take such a silly attitude.

89
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:52,019
You know I've always loved you,
and you're just as black as he is.

90
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:55,960
How could it be all right for me to
love you and wrong for me to love him?

91
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,363
Will you just stop
and think about that?

92
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,799
Listen. What are we having
for dinner tonight?

93
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,337
- Gotta make it something special.
- Celery soup and rump steak.

94
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:07,704
Oh, now, come on.
Turtle soup and tournedos...

95
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:10,642
and one of your best pies.

96
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,679
It's Mom!

97
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:18,184
Joey, darling.
What the hell? Joey!

98
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:20,743
- Mom, I'm here!
- Hello, darling. Are you all right?

99
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:23,949
- There's nothing wrong, is there?
- Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine.

100
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:27,653
I rang the gallery to tell Hilary
that Cazalet agreed to our scheme.

101
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,822
He has? That's marvelous.
I knew he would.

102
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,163
She said you were back. She thought
you might have a surprise for me.

103
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,999
What did she mean?
Do I hear someone?

104
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,131
- Is there someone here?
- Oh, Mom, I'm so happy.

105
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:43,199
I've never been so happy in all my life.
I'm just...

106
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:46,007
Bursting. Yeah, I can see that.

107
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,947
And I'm already feeling happy for you.
Do I know him?

108
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:52,213
No. That's just it.
I only met him myself ten days ago.

109
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:55,221
You wouldn't believe what's happened
in just ten days.

110
00:11:55,289 --> 00:12:00,090
I think I might if you'd pipe down
long enough to tell me.

111
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,094
- Mom...
- Lots of wonderful things happen...

112
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:04,824
He's so wonderful!

113
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:08,493
I've never known anyone like him.
Never known anything like this.

114
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:12,437
I fell in love with him
in 20 minutes.

115
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:15,270
Well, that was quick.

116
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,374
Well, Dad, I wanted to stop
on the way back...

117
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:23,280
but time got so short
and I've got to get to work.

118
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,754
Yeah, but I still don't understand
why you couldn't spend one day with us.

119
00:12:28,822 --> 00:12:33,623
Well, the fact is, Dad,
I met this girl.

120
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:36,458
You what? You met a girl?
Why didn't you say so?

121
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,988
Mary, he says he met a girl.
Why, that's good news.

122
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:43,559
- She live up there in San Francisco?
- She lives up here. I'm at her house.

123
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,969
He says he's at her house now,
the girl's house.

124
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,770
Well, that's different, son.
Where'd you meet her? Hawaii?

125
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:52,369
Yes, in Hawaii,
and I wanted to meet her folks, see?

126
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,573
That sounds good, son.
I mean, serious.

127
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,481
Yes, it's serious.

128
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:59,485
Well, this is quite a surprise.

129
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:02,317
Yeah, she's surprising
in a lot of ways, Dad.

130
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,414
Your mother says,
"Is she pretty? '

131
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:07,392
- Yes, she's very pretty.
- She's pretty. What?

132
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:09,486
Your mother says,
"How old is she, son?"

133
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:11,656
Mary, what the hell difference
does that make?

134
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:14,223
Well, she's only 23, Dad.

135
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:16,394
Twenty-three. Well, that's good.
You want my opinion?

136
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,700
You're 37.
That's just the right difference.

137
00:13:18,772 --> 00:13:21,263
Women age faster than men,
you know what I mean?

138
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,176
- You reckon to marry the girl, son?
- Well, we've been talking about it.

139
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:27,440
But...

140
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:31,951
Dad, there's one or two problems,
you see?

141
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,615
That I'll write to you about...

142
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:39,591
on the plane to New York tonight,
all right?

143
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,887
He's so calm...

144
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:46,023
and sure of everything.

145
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,001
He doesn't have
any tensions in him.

146
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:51,003
He knows what he believes...

147
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:55,770
and what he thinks is right
and why and where he's going.

148
00:13:56,944 --> 00:13:59,913
Oh, Mom, there's one thing
I must tell you.

149
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,916
He was married before,
and he had a son.

150
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,679
It was so tragic.

151
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:10,289
Both his wife and his son were killed
in a train accident...

152
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:12,325
in Belgium eight years ago.

153
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,828
And John...

154
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,456
I haven't even told you
his name.

155
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:24,063
Mom, it's John Wade Prentice.

156
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:26,072
Isn't that a lovely name?

157
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,971
John Wade...

158
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:30,776
Joanna Prentice...

159
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,277
I'll be.

160
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,648
But Mom...

161
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:39,015
there's something else
that I must tell you...

162
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,920
that John's been concerned about,
very deeply concerned.

163
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,586
He's been worrying for the past week
whether you and Dad would be upset if...

164
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:50,186
Well, it's about time.

165
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,562
I was wondering where you'd been.

166
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:54,225
Mom...

167
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,336
this is John.

168
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,542
Doctor Prentice...

169
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:06,340
I'm so pleased to meet you.

170
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:09,712
I'm pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Drayton.

171
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,014
I take it Joanna's already busted out
with the big news.

172
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:17,989
Well, she has told me a good deal
and all very quickly too.

173
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:21,892
Well, she's only known me
for ten days...

174
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,294
so she can't tell you
when I'm blushing.

175
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:27,060
That could be another problem
for us.

176
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,671
Mrs. Drayton,
I'm medically qualified...

177
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,265
so I hope you wouldn't
think it presumptuous if I say...

178
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:38,573
you ought to sit down
before you fall down.

179
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,840
He thinks you're gonna faint
because he's a Negro.

180
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,846
Well...

181
00:15:43,917 --> 00:15:46,408
I don't think
I'm going to faint.

182
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,582
But I'll sit down anyway.

183
00:15:57,698 --> 00:16:00,258
Can't we all sit down?

184
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:15,545
Well...

185
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,645
I suppose it would be all right
if I said, "My goodness," wouldn't it?

186
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,457
Well, my goodness.

187
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:29,751
- Do we mind her saying, "My goodness"?
- I don't mind.

188
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,855
What did they say?
Did you tell them about me?

189
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:33,024
- Yes.
- What'd they say?

190
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,627
They said I sounded serious
and asked if you were pretty.

191
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,136
I said you were.

192
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,833
They said this was a big surprise.

193
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:42,705
I said it was.

194
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:45,540
Well, what did they say when you
told them I wasn't a colored girl?

195
00:16:45,612 --> 00:16:48,274
I didn't. It felt like
too big a shock for the telephone.

196
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:51,579
After all, a lot of people will think
that we're a very shocking pair.

197
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:52,914
Isn't that right?

198
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,750
I know what you mean.

199
00:16:58,292 --> 00:16:59,919
Tillie's made us some sandwiches.

200
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:02,018
- Let's go outside.
- Yes, let's.

201
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:06,088
- Come on, Dr. Prentice.
- I can explain it all in two minutes.

202
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:09,499
You see, John was invited to lecture
at Hawaii University...

203
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,504
and we met at this big party
at the dean's.

204
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,006
After the party,
we went for a long drive.

205
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,100
- Thank you.
- And since then, we've been together.

206
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:19,737
We've been swimming every day.

207
00:17:19,813 --> 00:17:23,681
Then John was supposed to fly back to
Los Angeles Saturday to see his parents.

208
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,308
That's where they live.

209
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,679
Thank you, Tillie.

210
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:35,557
Try one of these.
They're great.

211
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:37,859
- Do you want some coffee?
- No, thanks. No coffee.

212
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,922
Does your father know
that you're back?

213
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,525
No, I was going to phone him.
Do you think he'd come back early if...

214
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,061
He's coming back early, all right.
He's playing golf with Monsignor Ryan.

215
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:47,538
That's marvelous.

216
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,600
Then he can meet John
and we can all talk over dinner...

217
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:53,510
because John has to fly
to New York tonight to see a friend...

218
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,138
at Columbia University.

219
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:57,183
Then tomorrow night,
he's flying to Geneva...

220
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,810
to do three month's work
for the World Health Organization.

221
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:04,152
And I intend to fly to Geneva next week
so that we can be married.

222
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,158
And that's the whole situation.

223
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:08,353
In a nutshell.

224
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,986
Except that he thinks...

225
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:12,725
that the fact he's a Negro and I'm not
creates a serious problem.

226
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:14,859
Does he?

227
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:17,233
I've told him 97 times...

228
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,738
that it wouldn't make the slightest
difference to you or Dad.

229
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:23,071
But he just wouldn't believe me.
So that's why we're here.

230
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,140
And that's why he's watching you
so closely right now...

231
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:28,647
while he's pretending
not to watch you at all.

232
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,314
She's absolutely right, Mrs. Drayton.
I'm sorry.

233
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:36,356
I told her not to spring all this
on you so suddenly.

234
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,914
But... Look,
if your father's coming home...

235
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,392
you could at least say
that I'm somebody you met in Hawaii.

236
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:44,123
- Now, really?
- Give him a half hour to get adjusted.

237
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:47,564
But what for?
He still has to be told, doesn't he?

238
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:53,238
Well, you should make up your minds
because I think I just heard his car.

239
00:18:58,278 --> 00:18:59,711
Mr. Matt.

240
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,271
- Hi. How are you?
- All hell's done broke loose.

241
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,613
- That waste disposal out again?
- It ain't that.

242
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,380
Just remember,
all hell's done broke loose.

243
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:09,911
- What's happened? Where's Christina?
- She's on the terrace with little Joey.

244
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,289
- With Joey?
- And somebody called Dr. Prentice.

245
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,555
Doctor? There's a doc...

246
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:17,790
Well, what's wrong?
What's happened? Joey!

247
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,000
Here he comes.

248
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:25,766
- Daddy! How are you?
- What's happened? What are you doing?

249
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,104
- Tillie said there was a doctor here.
- There is! Dr. John Wade Prentice.

250
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:30,837
- This is my dad.
- Pleased to meet you.

251
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:32,811
How are you? Nice to know you.
But what is it?

252
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:35,006
- Is something wrong?
- There's nothing wrong.

253
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:36,515
I decided to come home early.

254
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:39,518
Oh, Dr. Prentice and I
met in Hawaii...

255
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:41,315
and we flew back in the same plane
this morning.

256
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,824
Oh, well, sit down.

257
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:46,586
I thought something was really wrong.
Tillie said...

258
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,458
Tillie's behaving very strangely today.
Would you like coffee?

259
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:53,863
No, thanks. I have a date to play golf
with Monsignor Ryan.

260
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:56,664
How are you? What's the matter,
you having a chill?

261
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,728
No, darling, I'm fine.

262
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:00,670
I...

263
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,268
Doctor, where are you practicing?
In San Francisco?

264
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:06,505
- Sit down.
- No, sir.

265
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,208
I'm just here for one day.

266
00:20:09,282 --> 00:20:12,217
Oh, where is your practice?
Hawaii?

267
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:17,222
Well, no, not...
I'm not established in any one place.

268
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,724
I'm in tropical medicines, mostly,
in Africa...

269
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,055
these past few years.

270
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:23,358
Well, that sounds interesting.

271
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,660
Everything about Dr. Prentice
is interesting.

272
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:27,597
I'm sure it is.

273
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,760
I wish I had more time,
but if you'll excuse me.

274
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:32,031
Couldn't you be a half hour late
and stay and talk with us?

275
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,573
I'd love to, but I mustn't keep
the Monsignor waiting.

276
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:37,041
No, I'm gonna be late as it is.
Will I be seeing you later, Doctor?

277
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,305
You certainly will.

278
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:40,869
Good.
Well, that's good.

279
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:43,279
Dr. Prentice will be here
for dinner, Matt.

280
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,784
Oh, fine. Then you can tell me
all about the African...

281
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:48,013
There's a great deal to tell too.
Isn't there, Mom?

282
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:53,989
Well, fine.
See you all later.

283
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,088
What the hell
is going on here?

284
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,320
- This doesn't make sense either.
- Well, I told you, didn't I?

285
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,362
What'd you tell him?
Look, Chris...

286
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:31,522
if you don't explain to me
in the next few minutes...

287
00:21:31,598 --> 00:21:33,930
I can explain it, Mr. Drayton.

288
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,968
You can?
Well, let's have it

289
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:37,970
Well, it's my fault.

290
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:41,932
You see,
we have sort of a situation here.

291
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,339
Joanna and I didn't just meet
in Hawaii.

292
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,312
We spend a good deal of time
together.

293
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:51,882
I mean, all the time
after we met.

294
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:55,444
And, well, we have this problem:

295
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,718
I fell in love with your daughter.

296
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,823
And, as incredible
as it may seem...

297
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:07,992
she fell in love with me.

298
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:11,431
And we flew back
to San Francisco...

299
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:15,440
to see if you or Mrs. Drayton would have
any objections if we got married.

300
00:22:20,947 --> 00:22:23,438
Joanna told her mother
as soon as she walked in...

301
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:26,383
and I had the stupid idea,
that maybe...

302
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:29,422
there was some way to...

303
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:32,754
break this gently.

304
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,336
Daddy, you're making
John and me nervous.

305
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,745
Am I?
Well, I wouldn't want to do that.

306
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:59,182
I wouldn't want to make anybody nervous.
How about you? Are you nervous?

307
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,187
Sit down, Doctor,
before you make me nervous.

308
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,360
Would anybody like
a cup of coffee?

309
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:13,263
What did she say
when Joanna told her?

310
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:17,394
- Did she raise any objections?
- None, so far. There hasn't been time.

311
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,495
What objections?

312
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:23,702
Dad, I know this is sort of a shock
because it's sudden and unexpected...

313
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,712
and it never occurred to me
that I might fall in love with a Negro.

314
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,614
But I did, and nothing in the world
is gonna change that.

315
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:34,347
Even if you had any objections,
I wouldn't let him go now if...

316
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:37,413
you were the governor of Alabama...
I mean, if Mom were.

317
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,426
Tell him, will you?

318
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:43,860
Tell John if you have any objections
and then you could go play golf.

319
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,798
Well, what is it
you expect me to say?

320
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:50,893
If you want me to think about this,
you'll have to give me time to think.

321
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,804
The doctor says you have a problem.
You certainly have.

322
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:57,707
If you're expecting a sensible
statement, you'll have to give me time.

323
00:23:57,777 --> 00:23:59,711
Does that sound reasonable?

324
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:03,271
It's reasonable, Mr. Drayton,
but not quite practical.

325
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,444
You see, Matt...

326
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:09,420
there's sort of
a special problem.

327
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,219
See, I've got to fly
to New York tonight...

328
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:14,226
and on to Switzerland
tomorrow night.

329
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:17,593
Yes, and what Joey wants...
what she proposes...

330
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,724
is to go to Geneva herself
so they can be married...

331
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,768
within the next couple of weeks.

332
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,895
What the hell is all the rush?

333
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,905
We know that we want
to get married.

334
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:30,636
And unless somebody does have any
objections, why should we waste time?

335
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,644
John and I aren't gonna
change our minds.

336
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:36,338
Are you saying...
Are you telling me...

337
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:39,214
that you want an answer today...

338
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:41,219
about how your mother and I feel?

339
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:45,587
Of course. We want you and Mom
to state absolutely clearly...

340
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:47,319
that you have
no objections whatever...

341
00:24:47,394 --> 00:24:50,921
and that when we do get married,
we'll have your blessing.

342
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:03,073
Now, are you gonna play golf
or not?

343
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:04,735
No.

344
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:07,245
I'll just call it off.
Excuse me, Doctor.

345
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:16,722
And that's my dad.
Do you like him?

346
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,055
- I don't know. Does he like me?
- I don't know either.

347
00:25:20,126 --> 00:25:22,060
When he puts on
his American eagle face...

348
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:24,392
nobody can tell what he's thinking,
except Mom.

349
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:27,956
I don't think he liked any of us
after the silly way we began.

350
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:30,730
Excuse me, will you?
Give John some more coffee.

351
00:25:30,804 --> 00:25:33,102
She's beautiful, Joanna.

352
00:25:33,173 --> 00:25:35,539
She's even better looking than you.
You know that?

353
00:25:35,608 --> 00:25:38,042
Hello, Edie?

354
00:25:38,111 --> 00:25:40,739
Two things, Edie.
Both of them urgent.

355
00:25:40,814 --> 00:25:44,750
Call up Monsignor Ryan and tell him
I can't play this afternoon.

356
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:48,982
Tell him something's come up,
something personal at home.

357
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:50,488
Then call the library...

358
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:53,924
and see if they've got any dope
on a John Wade Prentice.

359
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:58,828
Prentice. He's a doctor of medicine.
Fellow about 35, 36...

360
00:25:58,898 --> 00:26:01,560
- Oh, Matt.
- He's a colored fellow.

361
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:04,535
Yeah.
If they haven't got anything...

362
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,198
call up the medical association
and see what they've got.

363
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:11,039
Get anything you can, will you, Edie?
All right. Hurry and call me back.

364
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,602
Surely there can't be
any necessity for that.

365
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,515
- It can't do any harm, either.
- But Joey said he was lecturing...

366
00:26:18,585 --> 00:26:20,177
at the university in Hawaii.

367
00:26:20,253 --> 00:26:23,154
Tell me something. This ever occur
to you that this might happen?

368
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:29,391
Never occurred to me either.
Not once.

369
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:32,998
Can you tell me your reaction?

370
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:36,399
- How do you feel about it?
- Oh, I don't know.

371
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,733
I was shaken at first.
I still am, I suppose.

372
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,365
But, Matt, they're serious.
They mean what they're saying.

373
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:43,375
Both of them.
They know what they're doing.

374
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:46,173
No, they may mean what they're saying,
I accept that.

375
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:49,010
But they don't know what they're doing.
I won't accept that.

376
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:53,578
If I'm not intruding...

377
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:56,912
Of course not.
Please, come in.

378
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,187
I'd like to have a couple of minutes
with the two of you, if I may?

379
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,194
Sure, Doctor.
Come on in.

380
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:09,799
There's something you both
ought to know. I made a decision.

381
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,637
Joanna doesn't know about it,
and I don't see why she should.

382
00:27:14,374 --> 00:27:16,035
What is it, Doctor?

383
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:18,270
Joanna thinks she's committed...

384
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,642
and that our whole future
is settled...

385
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:22,977
but there is no real commitment.

386
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:25,711
And up to now,
nothing is settled at all.

387
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:28,276
I don't understand.

388
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:31,380
Joanna said you're going to be married
no matter what we think about it.

389
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,320
Well, that's not the case.

390
00:27:34,394 --> 00:27:37,386
Unless you two approve...
and without any reservations at all...

391
00:27:37,463 --> 00:27:38,896
there won't be any marriage.

392
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,066
Well, why, John?

393
00:27:43,136 --> 00:27:45,070
Why have you decided that?

394
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:47,668
Well, Mrs. Drayton...

395
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,038
this thing has happened so quickly...

396
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:52,976
I'm just as startled
as you must be.

397
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,913
Two weeks ago, I would have said
such a thing was inconceivable.

398
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:59,107
But two weeks ago...

399
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:01,119
I had not met Joanna.

400
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:07,017
She's not at all
like anyone I've ever known.

401
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:11,194
It's not just that our color difference
doesn't matter to her.

402
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:14,199
It's that she doesn't seem to think
there is any difference.

403
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,238
The trouble is,
this thing has come up...

404
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:23,901
at a time when I already have
all the problems I need.

405
00:28:23,977 --> 00:28:26,070
And I feel that I couldn't afford
to get married...

406
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:29,239
if it meant that I would have to take
on any special problems...

407
00:28:29,315 --> 00:28:32,182
in addition to those
we're obviously going to have.

408
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:37,289
When you say "special problems,"
Doctor, what do you mean?

409
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:40,116
Well...

410
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:46,798
Your attitude, Mr. Drayton...

411
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,868
and yours, Mrs. Drayton.

412
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:54,204
Joanna is very close
to both of you.

413
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:59,209
If, by marrying me, she damaged
her relationship with either of you...

414
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,009
the pain of it
would be too much for her.

415
00:29:03,149 --> 00:29:06,016
I wouldn't know how to deal
with that kind of situation.

416
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:08,519
In any case,
I wouldn't even want to try.

417
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,419
Well, I'm glad you told us,
Doctor.

418
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,657
Don't misunderstand me.
I love your daughter.

419
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:24,931
There is nothing I wouldn't do to keep
her as happy as she was the day we met.

420
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:27,268
But it seems to me,
without your approval...

421
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,274
we will make no sense at all.

422
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:32,776
That is why I'm asking for...

423
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:36,542
the clearest possible statement
of what your attitude is going to be.

424
00:29:39,118 --> 00:29:41,712
I appreciate that, Doctor.

425
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:45,280
It's almost in the form
of an ultimatum.

426
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,926
Not quite, Mr. Drayton.

427
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,862
All you have to say
is good-bye.

428
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:58,597
Well, that's where it's at.

429
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:02,607
Thank you for the opportunity
to speak my peace.

430
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:11,813
Well...

431
00:30:11,884 --> 00:30:14,284
still think you ought to have someone
check on him?

432
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,288
No.

433
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,290
He's right about Joey too.

434
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,519
- You know that, don't you?
- Yes.

435
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:24,586
Thank God he is. That's the way I feel.
Thank God he's right.

436
00:30:24,664 --> 00:30:26,598
She's 23 years old,
and the way she is...

437
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:30,295
is just exactly the way
we brought her up to be.

438
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,032
We answered her questions.
She listened to our answers.

439
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:35,301
We told her it was wrong
to believe...

440
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,436
that white people were somehow
essentially superior to black people...

441
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:42,481
or the brown or the red
or the yellow ones, for that matter.

442
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:45,517
People who thought that way
were wrong to think that way.

443
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:50,613
Sometimes hateful, usually stupid,
but always wrong.

444
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,181
That's what we said...

445
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:57,559
and when we said it,
we did not add...

446
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,155
"But don't ever fall in love
with a colored man."

447
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:07,472
Edie, Mr. Drayton.
Do you want the whole story?

448
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,668
- Yeah, what is it, Edie?
- He's an important guy.

449
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:13,678
Just the main points:
Born Los Angeles, 1930...

450
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,840
graduated maxima cum laude
John Hopkins, '54...

451
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,749
assistant professor,
Yale Medical School, '55...

452
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:22,720
three years professor,
London School of Tropical Medicine...

453
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:25,815
three years assistant director,
World Health Organization...

454
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:29,589
two textbooks and a list of monographs
and medical society honors...

455
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:31,254
as long as your arm.

456
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,699
Married Elizabeth Bowers, 1955,
one son, John Wade.

457
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:39,602
Oh, both killed in an accident
in 1959.

458
00:31:39,672 --> 00:31:42,539
- There's a lot more here.
- No, that's all right. Thanks.

459
00:31:58,224 --> 00:32:00,658
What's the $2.20?

460
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:03,559
He made a call to Los Angeles
to his parents.

461
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:07,759
I guess he doesn't bum
free telephone calls either.

462
00:32:07,834 --> 00:32:11,292
I can certainly understand why he didn't
have much to say about himself.

463
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,861
Who the hell would believe him?

464
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:22,147
I beg your pardon, lady.

465
00:32:22,215 --> 00:32:24,149
He loves me, he loves me not.

466
00:32:25,952 --> 00:32:29,820
Tell me, what do you think? Aren't they
exactly the way I said they were?

467
00:32:29,889 --> 00:32:32,084
I must admit,
they are very special people.

468
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,251
- Shall I tell you something?
- What's that?

469
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,091
For a whole week,
I've been nervous.

470
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,597
No. I don't believe it.

471
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:42,828
Not about what they'd ultimately feel.
Just about their first reaction.

472
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:45,962
I thought it was just possible
for the first time in 23 years...

473
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,268
they might let me down
for the first half hour.

474
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,970
You're a phony. You know that?
You're a big phony.

475
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:17,360
Well...

476
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:22,734
She's always been
a happy human being.

477
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:26,141
She laughed out loud
before she was six months old.

478
00:33:27,313 --> 00:33:29,611
She was happy as a baby.

479
00:33:29,682 --> 00:33:33,618
Happy as a little girl.
Happy all through school and college.

480
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:39,682
But I don't think
I've ever seen her...

481
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,024
quite so happy
as she is right now.

482
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:49,367
And I have to be happy
for her, Matt.

483
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:51,027
And I am.

484
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:56,234
I feel happy for her.

485
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:02,179
And proud of the fact
that we helped make her.

486
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,684
And whatever happens now,
I feel glad...

487
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:08,015
that Joey's Joey.

488
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:37,683
How are you today?
Having a steak fry, huh?

489
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,516
Well, now, there she is.
How are you today?

490
00:34:41,587 --> 00:34:43,953
Wanna give me a lift to Market Street?
Save me a cab.

491
00:34:44,023 --> 00:34:45,957
You know it, doll.

492
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:48,789
I hope these is better
than the last we had, hotshot.

493
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:52,297
Lady, don't look at me. I deliver it.
I don't rustle the cattle.

494
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:55,095
You said to remind you
to open the wine.

495
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:28,460
Civil rights is one thing.

496
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:30,559
This here is something else.

497
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:32,729
I went out on to the terrace.

498
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:35,706
Oh, I'll never forget it.
It was so beautiful.

499
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:38,642
It was already dark
and the moon was rising.

500
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:41,680
I guess I didn't see him at first
because I was looking at the view.

501
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:43,339
But he was standing there.

502
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:46,647
Then all of a sudden
he moved or something, and I jumped.

503
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:52,551
And he just stood there,
looking at me and sort of...

504
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:57,028
- Ah, you're burning your shirt.
- Oh, yes. Sort of smiling.

505
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:59,826
"Hello," I said.
"Who are you?"

506
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:02,967
And I think he thought I was...

507
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,969
you know, attractive.

508
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:08,533
Anyway, finally, he said...

509
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:11,974
"Well, do you think
it could possibly matter?"

510
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:16,378
- And it's just crazy, and I admit it.
- You'd better let me do this.

511
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:20,886
But 20 minutes later,
I felt I was in love with him.

512
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:24,889
Mom, how long did it take you
to fall in love with Dad?

513
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:29,155
Oh, well, nothing like
so long as 20 minutes.

514
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,958
- You mean, is that really true?
- Yes, that's really true.

515
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:33,794
Oh, Mom.

516
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:36,232
Joey, I want to ask you something.

517
00:36:36,302 --> 00:36:40,500
How deeply are you and John in...
No, I have no right to ask.

518
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,940
How deeply involved? Do you mean,
have we been to bed together?

519
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:46,170
I don't mind you asking me that.
We haven't.

520
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,507
He wouldn't.

521
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,679
I don't think he was in doubt
about my feelings, but he wouldn't.

522
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,688
You're burning my shirt.

523
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,715
He's been concerned the whole time
about my getting hurt somehow.

524
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,120
They're still talking.

525
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:08,030
Wouldn't you think
they'd have said everything by now?

526
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,934
Are you saying they don't have
any special sense of rhythm?

527
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:13,699
That's right.

528
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,866
But, hell, you can see it.

529
00:37:15,941 --> 00:37:19,433
You can't turn on the television set
without seeing those kids dancing...

530
00:37:19,512 --> 00:37:22,037
and I say the colored kids
are better than the white kids.

531
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:26,380
But there's an explanation for that.
It's our dancing, and it's our music.

532
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,215
We brought it here.

533
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,585
I mean, you can do the Watusi...

534
00:37:30,656 --> 00:37:34,285
but we are the Watusi,
if you know what I mean.

535
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,294
I remember,
when I was about your age...

536
00:37:36,362 --> 00:37:41,527
my sports editor telling me that Negroes
would never be able to play baseball.

537
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,534
Now, I suppose if he wanted to...

538
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:46,196
Willie Mays could be elected
mayor of San Francisco.

539
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:49,173
I own a newspaper,
but I couldn't be elected dogcatcher.

540
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:53,200
Well, I don't guess
you want to be dogcatcher any more...

541
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:55,304
than he wants to be
mayor of San Francisco.

542
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:57,315
No, I suppose that's right.

543
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,952
Doctor, we've talked about
a good many things...

544
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:06,856
but there's one thing
we haven't talked about.

545
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:10,384
Have you given any thought to
the problems your children will have?

546
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:15,490
Yes, and they'll have some.
And we'll have the children.

547
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:18,731
Otherwise,
you couldn't call it a marriage.

548
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,097
Is that the way Joey feels?

549
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:25,606
She feels that all of our children will
be president of the United States...

550
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,612
and they'll all have
colorful administrations.

551
00:38:32,284 --> 00:38:34,218
Well, you made her, Mr. Drayton.

552
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:36,982
I just met her in Hawaii.

553
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,524
But how do you feel
about that problem?

554
00:38:39,592 --> 00:38:44,359
Well, frankly, I think your daughter
is a bit optimistic.

555
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,625
I'd settle
for secretary of state.

556
00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:55,774
Would you think it was some kind
of cowardice if I told you...

557
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:59,743
that no matter how confident you two are
I'm just a little scared.

558
00:38:59,812 --> 00:39:01,939
No, it wouldn't.

559
00:39:03,048 --> 00:39:05,573
But you never know.
Things are changing.

560
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:09,053
I have a feeling they're
not changing anywhere else...

561
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:11,214
as fast as they are
in my own backyard.

562
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,656
Just tell me this.

563
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,660
Don't you think this quick decision...

564
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:19,562
about how we feel about this thing
is just a little unfair?

565
00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:21,293
In a way, I do.

566
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:29,568
But it wasn't my idea
that everything be settled so quickly.

567
00:39:29,642 --> 00:39:32,372
Your daughter said
there's no problem.

568
00:39:32,444 --> 00:39:37,108
She says, "My dad is a lifelong fighting
liberal who loathes race prejudice...

569
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:40,049
and has spent his whole life
fighting against discrimination."

570
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:43,987
She said, "My parents...
They'll welcome you with open arms."

571
00:39:44,056 --> 00:39:46,024
And I said...

572
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:48,491
"Oh, I sure want to meet them."

573
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,361
Telephone!
It's Los Angeles!

574
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,601
- Take it in my study.
- Thank you.

575
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,841
- Hello?
- Dr. Prentice?

576
00:40:13,919 --> 00:40:16,683
- Yes, this is he.
- Hello. That you, Little John?

577
00:40:16,755 --> 00:40:19,690
Hi, Dad. What's up, man?
Dr. Graves call again?

578
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:23,489
Oh, no, it's not that, son.
I just had an idea.

579
00:40:23,562 --> 00:40:27,191
What would you say to us
flying up there to spend the evening?

580
00:40:27,266 --> 00:40:30,326
- This evening?
- We could be up there at 6:30.

581
00:40:30,402 --> 00:40:34,236
I thought maybe we could take you
and your young lady friend for dinner.

582
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,433
- Tell them to come to dinner.
- Just a minute.

583
00:40:36,508 --> 00:40:39,341
- I'm having dinner with her folks.
- Don't be silly.

584
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:42,107
- Tell them they're invited to dinner.
- Who's that speaking? The young lady?

585
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:43,773
Yes, that's her.

586
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:46,750
No, just a minute. You haven't asked
your mother, and there's Tillie.

587
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,346
Won't you come to dinner,
you and Mrs. Prentice?

588
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:52,014
John and I will meet your plane.

589
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:54,321
- Stop butting in.
- Who am I talking to? John?

590
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:55,826
Hi, Dad.

591
00:40:55,894 --> 00:41:00,024
Looks like she wants us
even if you don't. We want to meet her.

592
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:03,535
- So we'll see you at 6:30. What?
- Oh, no.

593
00:41:03,602 --> 00:41:06,503
- See?
- Your mother says she's pleased.

594
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:09,541
Oh, hell, he knows that.
All right, son.

595
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:12,008
- Dad!
- We'll see you later. Bye.

596
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,613
What's the matter?

597
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,275
Mom!

598
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,712
John's father and mother
are coming to dinner.

599
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:25,723
Oh, good.

600
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:28,123
- Marvelous.
- We'll meet their plane at 6:30.

601
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:30,161
Fine.
You'll tell Tillie, won't you?

602
00:41:32,231 --> 00:41:36,031
I told you,
my folks, they don't...

603
00:41:36,101 --> 00:41:38,262
They think
you're a colored girl.

604
00:41:38,337 --> 00:41:41,135
- Why didn't you tell them?
- I was gonna write to them.

605
00:41:41,206 --> 00:41:42,969
What difference does it make?

606
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,102
Do you think they wouldn't come?
Call them back and tell them.

607
00:41:46,178 --> 00:41:49,238
They're gonna know anyway at 6:30
because I'll go with you to meet them.

608
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:51,782
That's not a good idea.
I'll meet them.

609
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:54,876
It gives me a chance to explain.
I have to explain.

610
00:41:54,953 --> 00:41:57,649
Why do you keep trying
to dramatize everything?

611
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:01,420
Look, I've told Pete and Judith that
we'll meet them for a drink at 5:30.

612
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:03,961
It gives us just enough time
to get to the airport.

613
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:07,430
She's my best and oldest friend
so you've just got to let them meet you.

614
00:42:11,603 --> 00:42:14,037
Did he tell you
about this medical plan of his?

615
00:42:14,106 --> 00:42:15,733
No. What?

616
00:42:15,808 --> 00:42:18,641
It's the damndest thing
you ever heard of.

617
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,736
They put a whole medical school
on about 20 trucks.

618
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:24,647
Then they run
into some African country...

619
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:28,049
pick up the brightest native kids...
hundreds at a time...

620
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,920
and put them through courses just like
they do the U.S. Army Corpsmen.

621
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,857
Only his idea is
that they're all specialists.

622
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,418
You know, each one trained
to do one simple thing...

623
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:42,991
like sewing up a wound
or delivering a baby or what have you.

624
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:46,799
They go into places where people
have never heard of an aspirin tablet...

625
00:42:46,872 --> 00:42:49,432
let alone a doctor.

626
00:42:49,508 --> 00:42:51,999
Imagine what that means.

627
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:55,945
For every thousand kids they train,
they can save a million lives a year.

628
00:42:56,014 --> 00:42:57,948
Now just think of that.

629
00:42:58,016 --> 00:43:00,610
He seems to have made
quite an impression on you.

630
00:43:00,686 --> 00:43:02,711
Yeah.

631
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:07,384
I asked him how he got so far.
You know, he's only 37.

632
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:12,294
He said he thought he got the best
breaks because everybody he met...

633
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:15,800
didn't want him to think
they were prejudiced against him.

634
00:43:15,868 --> 00:43:19,031
Yeah, he made an impression, all right.
I wouldn't know how to fault him.

635
00:43:19,104 --> 00:43:21,299
Are you trying to fault him?

636
00:43:21,373 --> 00:43:24,831
No, I'm not trying to fault him.
You know, his father is a mailman.

637
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,401
Retired now.
Lives in Los Angeles.

638
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,880
Now how do you suppose
a colored mailman...

639
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:34,715
produced a son
with all the qualities he has?

640
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:37,846
- You'll find out this evening.
- What?

641
00:43:39,725 --> 00:43:41,386
Guess who's coming to dinner?

642
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,189
Who?

643
00:43:43,262 --> 00:43:45,355
You mean, his parents?

644
00:43:46,965 --> 00:43:48,455
Now wait a minute.

645
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:52,198
- Whose idea was that?
- Joey invited them.

646
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:56,708
Yeah, Joey. We're being pressurized.
You know that, don't you?

647
00:43:57,776 --> 00:44:01,143
First there wasn't gonna be a marriage
unless we approved.

648
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:03,841
Then we had one day
to make up our minds.

649
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:06,908
Now we have to spend hours entertaining
somebody we never heard of.

650
00:44:06,985 --> 00:44:09,419
What the hell
is coming off here?

651
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:16,958
Oh, don't look at
those baby pictures.

652
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,429
That was at Klosters,
the year before last.

653
00:44:19,498 --> 00:44:21,432
I'll get it!
Just a second.

654
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:28,863
Monsignor Ryan!
How wonderful to see you.

655
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:31,375
- Well, good afternoon.
- Come on in. Good afternoon.

656
00:44:31,443 --> 00:44:33,911
Why are you here
when you should be in Hawaii?

657
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:38,211
What is the problem that caused your
father to chicken out on our golf game?

658
00:44:38,283 --> 00:44:42,913
- Who is this gentleman?
- Monsignor, this is Dr. John Prentice.

659
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:45,980
We met in Hawaii 11 days ago.
The two of us are going to be married.

660
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:50,392
Are you, indeed?
I take it you mean to each other.

661
00:44:50,462 --> 00:44:52,453
- Dr. Prentice.
- Monsignor.

662
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:54,931
Well, of course,
you're the problem.

663
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,525
I'm afraid I am.

664
00:44:57,603 --> 00:45:00,572
I knew nothing of this.
Why haven't your parents informed me?

665
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:03,005
They didn't know either.
We only flew back this morning.

666
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,010
Excuse me a second.
I forgot to tell Tillie something.

667
00:45:08,146 --> 00:45:09,738
Well...

668
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:14,077
- This was all very sudden, was it not?
- Yes, it was.

669
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:16,643
I suppose you two have had time
to consider what you're doing.

670
00:45:16,722 --> 00:45:18,952
No, we've not.

671
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:23,025
We'll be two more for dinner.
How many steaks did you get?

672
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,461
I got four
'cause I was told four.

673
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,964
Order two more because the doctor's
father and mother are coming.

674
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:31,992
- We'll be six.
- His father and mother! Here?

675
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,436
That's right.
If the butcher can't send 'em...

676
00:45:34,506 --> 00:45:37,168
tell him to put 'em
in a taxi.

677
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:40,678
It's gettin' more like
a holy rollers meetin' every minute.

678
00:45:40,746 --> 00:45:43,943
Of course!
I know about you.

679
00:45:44,016 --> 00:45:46,507
I read an article about you
in "Common Wheel."

680
00:45:46,585 --> 00:45:49,349
I shall want to talk to you
about that.

681
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:52,447
You know, this fellow you brought home
is a very important man?

682
00:45:52,524 --> 00:45:54,958
- Are you aware of that?
- I'm wholly aware of it.

683
00:45:55,027 --> 00:45:57,791
When I'm married to him,
I'll be important.

684
00:45:57,863 --> 00:46:01,230
I guess you will,
as a matter of fact.

685
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,791
- Where's Arnold Palmer?
- Dad and Mom are in the garden.

686
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:07,305
Good. Well, just go on
with what you're doing. Fore!

687
00:46:09,041 --> 00:46:11,805
Of all the friends we've ever had,
I guess he's the closest.

688
00:46:11,877 --> 00:46:15,438
We're not Catholics, but he and Dad
and Mom have done things together.

689
00:46:15,514 --> 00:46:18,540
You know,
sat on committees and things.

690
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:21,552
He's a wonderful man,
and we love him.

691
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,313
You're a remarkable fellow, Mike.

692
00:46:26,391 --> 00:46:28,416
You get younger every minute.

693
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:31,690
- Did you...
- Yes, I've just seen him.

694
00:46:31,763 --> 00:46:33,856
Handsome fellow, isn't he?

695
00:46:33,932 --> 00:46:35,866
Little Joey is nothing less
than radiant.

696
00:46:35,934 --> 00:46:39,165
It warms me chilly old heart
just to look at her.

697
00:46:39,237 --> 00:46:41,398
Aren't you just
a little shocked?

698
00:46:41,473 --> 00:46:44,840
Shocked?
Why should I be shocked?

699
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,040
I've known a good many cases
of marriages between races in my time.

700
00:46:49,114 --> 00:46:52,379
Strangely enough,
they usually work out quite well.

701
00:46:52,451 --> 00:46:54,180
I don't know why.

702
00:46:54,252 --> 00:46:57,483
Maybe because it requires
some special quality of effort...

703
00:46:57,556 --> 00:46:59,888
more consideration and compassion...

704
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:03,826
than most marriages
seem to generate these days.

705
00:47:03,895 --> 00:47:07,888
- Could that be it?
- Yes, it could.

706
00:47:07,966 --> 00:47:11,299
I'm glad you said that.
That's a beautiful thought.

707
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,339
You do have beautiful thoughts.

708
00:47:14,406 --> 00:47:16,340
That's my trade, you know.

709
00:47:18,143 --> 00:47:22,477
What about laddie over here?
You making heavy weather of it?

710
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,116
You know, this man is quite
a famous fellow in his own right.

711
00:47:27,185 --> 00:47:31,815
He's done incredible work in Asia
and some awful place in Africa.

712
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,155
Mom! Hilary's here.
She wants to see you.

713
00:47:36,862 --> 00:47:41,526
Excuse me, will you? Express some more
beautiful thoughts to the lad there.

714
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,172
Thank you.

715
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,232
I hope you won't think
that I'm prying, Doctor...

716
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:54,335
but naturally
one is curious.

717
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,678
- Naturally.
- We are going to be married.

718
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,075
Are you?

719
00:48:01,153 --> 00:48:03,246
Well, I didn't even know.

720
00:48:03,321 --> 00:48:05,551
I mean, Christina
hadn't even mentioned that...

721
00:48:05,624 --> 00:48:07,956
She didn't know.
It was a surprise to her too.

722
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:12,156
A surprise.
Well, I should think it was.

723
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,322
My dear!

724
00:48:13,398 --> 00:48:17,562
Joey tells me that congratulations
are in order, and you didn't even know.

725
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:29,813
What's the problem, Hilary?
What brings you all the way up here?

726
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:35,348
- Mr. Cazalet phoned about the pictures.
- Oh, that. Excuse us, will you?

727
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,581
I'll walk out to your car
with you.

728
00:48:37,656 --> 00:48:40,181
- I hope I'll be seeing you shortly.
- Actually, no.

729
00:48:40,258 --> 00:48:42,590
Dr. Prentice is leaving tonight...

730
00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:45,687
and Joey within
the next couple of weeks.

731
00:48:45,764 --> 00:48:49,291
Well, then you must permit me
to wish you every happiness.

732
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:51,562
Come along.

733
00:48:57,042 --> 00:48:59,476
My poor dear,
what a shock for you.

734
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:02,172
I knew something was up
when I came into the gallery.

735
00:49:02,247 --> 00:49:04,647
But this!
Whatever are you going to do about it?

736
00:49:04,716 --> 00:49:07,685
- I mean, the child is of age.
- Yes, the child is 23.

737
00:49:07,752 --> 00:49:12,121
Why didn't you simply ring up
with the Cazalet information?

738
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,988
Well, I must admit,
I was intensely curious.

739
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,652
I couldn't believe it.

740
00:49:16,728 --> 00:49:20,255
It's so unlike Joey to do anything
so appallingly stupid.

741
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:23,460
- Yes, come along.
- But what you must be going through.

742
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:25,867
You must try not to worry about it.

743
00:49:26,938 --> 00:49:29,236
Now I have some instructions
for you.

744
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:32,276
I want you to go straight back
to the gallery. Start your motor.

745
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,278
When you to the gallery,
tell Jennifer...

746
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,314
she will be looking after things
temporarily.

747
00:49:36,381 --> 00:49:39,475
She's to give me a ring if there's
anything she can't deal with herself.

748
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:43,612
Then go into the office
and make out a check for cash...

749
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:46,282
for the sum of $5,000.

750
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,849
Then carefully...

751
00:49:48,927 --> 00:49:51,191
remove absolutely everything...

752
00:49:51,263 --> 00:49:54,562
that might subsequently remind me
that you had ever been there...

753
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:57,067
including that yellow thing
with the blue bulbs...

754
00:49:57,135 --> 00:49:59,069
which you have
such an affection for.

755
00:49:59,137 --> 00:50:01,867
Then take the check for $5,000...

756
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,874
which I feel you deserve...

757
00:50:03,942 --> 00:50:07,878
and get permanently lost.

758
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:10,676
It's not that I don't want
to know you, although I don't.

759
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:14,241
It's just that I'm afraid
we're not really the sort of people...

760
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,117
that you can afford
to be associated with.

761
00:50:17,188 --> 00:50:20,123
Don't speak.
Just go.

762
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,464
You see that boy?
The tall one?

763
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:31,400
If he'd played his cards right,
you'd never even have met me.

764
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:34,199
But he fell for some girl
from Pomona.

765
00:50:34,272 --> 00:50:35,534
- That'll teach him.
- Mom!

766
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:39,373
Do you know what Hilary was doing?
She was being an absolute bitch.

767
00:50:39,444 --> 00:50:43,244
She was. I almost wish you'd fire her.
I really do.

768
00:50:43,315 --> 00:50:46,842
Joey, how can you be so hard?

769
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:50,581
She has a really quite ruthless streak.
You ought to be warned about it.

770
00:50:50,655 --> 00:50:52,680
She gets it
from her father.

771
00:50:53,858 --> 00:50:56,850
They need all the help
you can give them...

772
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:00,591
because they're going to have
special difficulties.

773
00:51:00,665 --> 00:51:03,259
No, don't budge.
Please, sit.

774
00:51:03,335 --> 00:51:05,394
Of course, they know all that.

775
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,633
They're serious people.
Fine, intelligent people.

776
00:51:08,707 --> 00:51:10,834
And if they know
what lies in store for them...

777
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:14,310
and they still want each other
enough to accept it...

778
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:17,314
I think it's plain as anything
that they love each other very much.

779
00:51:17,382 --> 00:51:20,374
You'll have to agree that any two people
who love each other that much...

780
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,319
deserve all the best luck
in the world.

781
00:51:24,422 --> 00:51:26,083
I don't know.

782
00:51:26,157 --> 00:51:28,717
I wish I didn't have the feeling
that they'll never make it...

783
00:51:28,793 --> 00:51:30,727
that the whole thing's
impossible.

784
00:51:32,931 --> 00:51:34,865
You feel that way, do you?

785
00:51:36,434 --> 00:51:38,368
You're really thrashing about then.

786
00:51:39,738 --> 00:51:42,138
That's very interesting, indeed.

787
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:45,040
And rather amusing, too,
to see a broken-down...

788
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:49,012
old phony liberal come face-to-face
with his principles.

789
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,638
Of course,
I always have believed...

790
00:51:51,716 --> 00:51:54,583
that in that
fighting liberal facade...

791
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:58,521
there must be some sort
of reactionary bigot trying to get out.

792
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:02,754
Oh, go to hell. You and your crowd
are still preaching hell.

793
00:52:04,062 --> 00:52:06,553
Well, I'm off.

794
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:09,464
As much as I'm enjoying
your discomfiture...

795
00:52:09,534 --> 00:52:12,469
I may be able to save a few souls
before supper.

796
00:52:12,537 --> 00:52:17,440
But, I am, as it happens,
free for dinner.

797
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:19,841
Please, come, 7:30.

798
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:23,005
The doctor's family are flying up
from Los Angeles.

799
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:27,575
Oh, well, in that case,
you'll actually need me.

800
00:52:27,652 --> 00:52:30,678
Otherwise, your side
won't even outnumber the blacks.

801
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:33,690
Thank you, my dear.

802
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,127
Half past seven.

803
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,395
What was that the Beatles sang?

804
00:52:40,465 --> 00:52:43,593
We can work it out
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

805
00:52:51,443 --> 00:52:53,536
Mom did it.
Do you think it looks like him?

806
00:52:53,611 --> 00:52:56,409
Well, it looks a little grim,
doesn't it?

807
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:59,882
- No, don't let me disturb you.
- Not at all.

808
00:52:59,951 --> 00:53:03,751
I hope you don't mind, but I've wrangled
an invitation to dinner.

809
00:53:03,822 --> 00:53:06,552
- Marvelous! I'm delighted you're coming.
- Thank you, my dear.

810
00:53:06,624 --> 00:53:09,650
- I'm very delighted to have met you.
- My pleasure, Monsignor.

811
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,288
- See you this evening.
- Certainly.

812
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:14,627
You know,
you two make me feel...

813
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:17,998
quite extraordinarily happy.

814
00:53:23,141 --> 00:53:27,077
I'd better tell Tillie. If you listen,
you'll hear her going through the roof.

815
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:35,342
I brought you
the latest bulletin.

816
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,752
Guess who's coming
to dinner now?

817
00:53:37,822 --> 00:53:40,757
The Reverend Martin Luther King?

818
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,554
You're so close.
It's Monsignor Ryan.

819
00:53:44,629 --> 00:53:47,860
Bake a second pie, will you?
You know how he loves your cooking.

820
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:49,957
Listen, is the big guest room
in order?

821
00:53:50,034 --> 00:53:52,662
Dr. Prentice wants to have
a shower and change.

822
00:53:53,805 --> 00:53:56,865
- He does?
- He does.

823
00:54:00,311 --> 00:54:02,336
Well, she's 23 years old.

824
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:04,381
I guess she has
a right to do as she pleases.

825
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,974
Yes, but that's not the point.
The doctor said...

826
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:11,818
I know what the doctor said. Could we
get out of here for a few minutes?

827
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,323
- Sure.
- What are the others doing?

828
00:54:13,391 --> 00:54:15,222
They're meeting Peter and Judith
for a drink...

829
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,261
and then they're going on
to the airport.

830
00:54:17,328 --> 00:54:20,593
All right, come on.
Come on, will you?

831
00:54:35,413 --> 00:54:38,348
Whatever happened to what's-his-name?
Homer?

832
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:40,714
That lawyer?
I thought she liked him very much.

833
00:54:40,785 --> 00:54:44,221
Nothing happened to Homer.
Dr. Prentice just happened to Joey.

834
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:48,225
It was only last Christmas
she said Homer had the inside track.

835
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:53,929
Isn't that the place where we got
the good ice cream? Let's get some.

836
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:56,523
It's after 5:00.
You'll spoil...

837
00:54:56,601 --> 00:54:58,535
A little ice cream can't hurt.

838
00:55:17,476 --> 00:55:20,570
- Yes?
- When I had ice cream before...

839
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:24,639
I had a special kind of flavor
that I liked very much.

840
00:55:24,717 --> 00:55:27,618
- But I can't remember what it was.
- I'll bring you the list.

841
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:29,882
No, you must know what it is.

842
00:55:29,956 --> 00:55:33,289
Daiquiri Ice? Honeycomb Candy?
Cocoa Coconut? Jamoca Almond Fudge?

843
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,795
Mocha Jamoca? Peanut Butter and Jelly?
Cinnamon Banana Mint?

844
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:39,592
- Must have been some other place.
- Fresh Oregon Boysenberry Sherbet?

845
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,061
That's it.

846
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:47,003
I'm sure that's it. Bring me
a Fresh Oregon Boysenberry.

847
00:55:47,073 --> 00:55:49,007
- Bring me a big one.
- Right.

848
00:55:49,075 --> 00:55:51,168
- Will you have some? It's delicious.
- No. Black coffee.

849
00:55:51,244 --> 00:55:56,375
One double Fresh Oregon Boysenberry
Sherbet and one black coffee. Thanks.

850
00:56:01,721 --> 00:56:04,713
You know, Matt...

851
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:08,851
I think Mike was right
that Joey is lucky.

852
00:56:08,928 --> 00:56:11,453
The work he's doing
is so important...

853
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,727
she'll be able to help him with it
and share it all with him.

854
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,734
The best break
any wife can have.

855
00:56:18,037 --> 00:56:20,267
You know, for us,
it's all been great...

856
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:24,298
but do you know
what was the best time of all?

857
00:56:24,377 --> 00:56:26,368
It was in the beginning
when everything was a struggle...

858
00:56:26,445 --> 00:56:31,144
and you were working too hard
and sometimes frightened...

859
00:56:31,217 --> 00:56:34,015
and there were times
when I felt...

860
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:38,546
that I really knew
that I was a help to you.

861
00:56:38,624 --> 00:56:41,422
That was the very best time of all
for me.

862
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:48,564
- One black coffee.
- Thank you.

863
00:56:48,634 --> 00:56:51,068
And one Fresh
Oregon Boysenberry Sherbet.

864
00:56:51,137 --> 00:56:53,071
Thank you.

865
00:57:04,684 --> 00:57:06,618
This is not the stuff.

866
00:57:06,686 --> 00:57:09,052
I never had this stuff
before in my life.

867
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,963
You know, it's not bad.

868
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:21,693
Not bad at all.
I kinda like it.

869
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:23,701
Fresh Oregon Boysenberry.

870
00:57:25,204 --> 00:57:26,637
Yes, sir.

871
00:57:26,706 --> 00:57:29,004
Well, when I had
the ice cream before...

872
00:57:29,075 --> 00:57:31,669
this isn't the stuff I had,
but I like it.

873
00:57:31,744 --> 00:57:34,679
- It's very good. I like it very much.
- Okay.

874
00:57:45,725 --> 00:57:49,183
- How do you do, Miss Binks?
- I got somethin' to say to you, boy.

875
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:52,992
Exactly what you tryin' to pull here?

876
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:56,865
I'm not trying to pull anything.
I was looking to find me a wife.

877
00:57:56,936 --> 00:58:00,565
Ain't that just likely!
You wanna answer me somethin'?

878
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:03,335
What kinda doctor
you supposed to be anyhow?

879
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:05,343
Would you believe horse?

880
00:58:06,812 --> 00:58:09,372
You make with witticisms
and all, huh?

881
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:11,313
Let me tell you somethin'.

882
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:13,477
You may think you're foolin'
Miss Joey and her folks.

883
00:58:13,552 --> 00:58:16,783
But you ain't foolin' me for a minute.
I see what you are.

884
00:58:16,856 --> 00:58:19,757
You're one of those smooth-talkin',
smart-ass niggers...

885
00:58:19,825 --> 00:58:21,793
just out for all you can get,
with your black power...

886
00:58:21,861 --> 00:58:23,795
and all that other
trouble-makin' nonsense.

887
00:58:23,863 --> 00:58:26,991
And you listen here. I brought up that
child from a baby in her cradle...

888
00:58:27,066 --> 00:58:29,626
and ain't nobody gonna harm her none
while I'm here watchin'.

889
00:58:29,702 --> 00:58:32,967
And as long as you are anywhere around
this house, I'm right here watchin'.

890
00:58:33,038 --> 00:58:35,529
You read me, boy?
You bring any trouble in here...

891
00:58:35,608 --> 00:58:38,702
and you just like to find out
what black power really means!

892
00:58:38,778 --> 00:58:42,179
And furthermore to that,
you ain't all that good-lookin'!

893
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:52,320
That was very good.

894
00:58:52,391 --> 00:58:56,088
If I come in again, remind me about
the Oregon Boysenberry, will you?

895
00:58:57,229 --> 00:58:59,288
Yeah, I sure will.
Thank you, sir.

896
00:59:02,868 --> 00:59:05,166
Should we take home
a couple of quarts for dessert?

897
00:59:05,237 --> 00:59:07,171
No, Tillie's baked some pies.

898
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:20,285
You stupid idiot!

899
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:25,247
Why can't you
look where you're going?

900
00:59:25,324 --> 00:59:27,554
Sorry, son,
but your car is so low...

901
00:59:27,626 --> 00:59:29,685
Of course you didn't see me!

902
00:59:29,762 --> 00:59:31,889
You weren't even looking
where you were going!

903
00:59:31,964 --> 00:59:34,296
Look what you did to my car!

904
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:36,061
It's my fault.
My insurance...

905
00:59:36,135 --> 00:59:38,865
Yeah, yeah. Who cares
about your lousy insurance?

906
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:40,906
I worked over three months on that!

907
00:59:40,973 --> 00:59:42,998
How much will it cost
to have it repaired?

908
00:59:43,075 --> 00:59:46,602
Look at it! Thirty or forty bucks
it'll cost. Did you see it?

909
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:48,840
Stupid old man.
He oughtn't be allowed out.

910
00:59:48,914 --> 00:59:51,348
He ought to be put away someplace
in a home or something.

911
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:55,148
There's fifty bucks! Don't bother
to have it fixed. Buy a new one!

912
00:59:57,022 --> 00:59:59,183
Some of these old guys,
they're senile!

913
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:02,089
Stupid old man.

914
01:00:02,862 --> 01:00:04,796
There oughta be a law!

915
01:00:15,007 --> 01:00:17,567
What the hell is it today?

916
01:00:17,643 --> 01:00:20,771
Less than 12'/. Of the people
in this city are colored people.

917
01:00:20,846 --> 01:00:23,781
I can't even have a dish
of Oregon "Boosenberry"...

918
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:25,783
without runnin' into one of them.

919
01:00:27,219 --> 01:00:29,449
You've

920
01:00:29,522 --> 01:00:33,288
Got to

921
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,691
Give a little

922
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:38,457
Take a little

923
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:41,056
And let your poor heart

924
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:43,863
Break a little

925
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:46,700
That's the story of

926
01:00:46,772 --> 01:00:51,607
That's the glory of love

927
01:00:53,646 --> 01:00:57,605
You've gotta laugh a little

928
01:00:57,683 --> 01:01:00,277
Cry a little

929
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:02,616
Before the clouds

930
01:01:02,688 --> 01:01:06,215
Roll by a little

931
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:07,759
That's the story of

932
01:01:07,826 --> 01:01:10,761
I can't tell you
how happy I am for you.

933
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:13,627
And the whole thing having
happened so quickly.

934
01:01:13,699 --> 01:01:15,860
You remember what it was
with Peter and me.

935
01:01:15,935 --> 01:01:17,869
It took us three years
to decide to get married...

936
01:01:17,937 --> 01:01:19,700
and we'd been living together
for two.

937
01:01:23,909 --> 01:01:25,274
To John and Joey.

938
01:01:25,344 --> 01:01:28,336
John and Joanna. He won't call me
anything but Joanna.

939
01:01:28,414 --> 01:01:30,644
- I'm beginning to like it too.
- To John and Joanna.

940
01:01:33,686 --> 01:01:37,178
Where you're so lucky
is in Joey's folks... Uh, Joanna's folks.

941
01:01:37,256 --> 01:01:39,850
You've only just met them,
but take my word for it.

942
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:42,485
Matt Drayton really stands
for something in this town.

943
01:01:42,561 --> 01:01:45,394
Yes. I know the Guardian's
always been a very good paper.

944
01:01:45,464 --> 01:01:48,024
It's a great paper,
and he made it what it is.

945
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,400
There's never been a public issue on
which Matt Drayton didn't take a stand.

946
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:55,440
When exactly are you flying over?
Sometime next week?

947
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:57,407
Just as soon
as I can arrange everything.

948
01:01:57,476 --> 01:02:00,411
Why next week? Why aren't you
flying over with John?

949
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,373
Why am I not flying over with you?

950
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:08,352
- Is your passport in order?
- Yes.

951
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:11,082
- Do you need clothes or anything?
- Nothing I couldn't get over there.

952
01:02:11,156 --> 01:02:15,991
Then it seems crazy for you to be
going alone when you could go together.

953
01:02:16,061 --> 01:02:19,792
- Why don't you both leave tonight?
- Why not?

954
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:37,447
It's 6:00. In an hour
they'll all be here for dinner.

955
01:02:37,516 --> 01:02:39,677
The doctor's plane leaves
at 10:45.

956
01:02:39,752 --> 01:02:44,689
No matter what it is, you're going
to have to tell them how you feel.

957
01:02:45,591 --> 01:02:48,583
I need more than one day
to make a decision like that.

958
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:50,822
It's the silliest thing
I ever heard of.

959
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:52,454
But I'll tell you this.

960
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:55,694
I am not going to try to pretend
that I'm happy about the whole thing...

961
01:02:55,768 --> 01:02:57,258
because I'm not.

962
01:02:57,336 --> 01:03:00,772
And if the doctor's decision
depends upon that, then too bad.

963
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,208
And I'm thinking only
of Joey's welfare.

964
01:03:04,276 --> 01:03:07,768
I have nothing against him personally,
but he's a grown man.

965
01:03:07,846 --> 01:03:11,942
He behaved irresponsibly in the first
place by letting this thing happen.

966
01:03:12,017 --> 01:03:14,850
Now he wants me to be happy
about a situation...

967
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,617
when I happen to know that they'll both
get their brains knocked out.

968
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:20,716
I'm sorry,
but that's the way I feel.

969
01:03:21,794 --> 01:03:23,625
And I know how you're reacting.

970
01:03:23,696 --> 01:03:27,154
You're so wrapped up in Joey's
excitement over the whole thing...

971
01:03:27,232 --> 01:03:29,894
that you are not behaving
in her best interest!

972
01:05:02,094 --> 01:05:03,493
Yes, Mom.

973
01:05:03,562 --> 01:05:05,792
But there wasn't any reason
not to go tonight.

974
01:05:05,864 --> 01:05:07,855
You can understand,
can't you, Mom?

975
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:11,334
My passport's in order. There's
nothing at all that I really need.

976
01:05:11,403 --> 01:05:13,496
And it won't
take me an hour to pack.

977
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:17,941
I'll be able to be with him.
We'll be together the whole time.

978
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:20,069
Mom, they're here.

979
01:05:20,145 --> 01:05:21,840
I can see them.

980
01:05:21,914 --> 01:05:24,041
They look like awfully nice people.

981
01:05:24,116 --> 01:05:26,107
His mother looks lovely.

982
01:05:26,185 --> 01:05:28,449
You break it to Dad for me,
will you?

983
01:05:29,488 --> 01:05:31,649
Well...

984
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:35,318
I guess I should have called you back
because there is this one thing...

985
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:37,919
I should have...

986
01:05:37,996 --> 01:05:40,829
I've been meaning
to write to you about it.

987
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:43,800
There was one thing
I didn't explain, Dad.

988
01:05:43,869 --> 01:05:45,962
And...

989
01:05:46,038 --> 01:05:48,063
I'm afraid it's gonna be
kind of a shock.

990
01:05:55,981 --> 01:05:58,381
You see what I mean?

991
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:02,318
Mom, Dad,
this is Joanna Drayton.

992
01:06:02,387 --> 01:06:04,184
Joanna, my mom and dad.

993
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:07,282
Mrs. Prentice, I'm so happy.

994
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,328
- Miss Drayton?
- Yes.

995
01:06:10,395 --> 01:06:13,592
Mr. Prentice,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

996
01:06:18,503 --> 01:06:20,528
I can explain.

997
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:25,134
I can imagine what's going on
in your mind...

998
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:28,509
but we can explain.

999
01:06:29,748 --> 01:06:31,113
You can?

1000
01:06:31,183 --> 01:06:33,447
Of course we can.

1001
01:06:33,518 --> 01:06:35,986
You have bags?

1002
01:06:36,054 --> 01:06:39,922
Of course you have bags.
Let's go get your bags.

1003
01:06:39,992 --> 01:06:41,926
Mama?

1004
01:06:45,998 --> 01:06:48,228
- What did your folks say?
- All's well.

1005
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,734
- Did you talk to your father?
- To Mom. But she'll tell him.

1006
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:55,105
Tonight?

1007
01:06:55,173 --> 01:06:57,539
- I thought I ought to tell you.
- That's out of the question.

1008
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:00,134
This whole damn thing is...
No, that's out of the question.

1009
01:07:00,212 --> 01:07:02,339
I'll tell you something else.
I couldn't do what you're about to do...

1010
01:07:02,414 --> 01:07:05,679
so I don't begin to understand
how you propose to go about it.

1011
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:08,219
But you can't break their hearts
over a drink...

1012
01:07:08,287 --> 01:07:10,221
and expect them
to sit down to dinner.

1013
01:07:10,289 --> 01:07:13,122
Don't you think I know that?

1014
01:07:13,191 --> 01:07:16,160
I have to talk to the doctor...
I'll talk to him after dinner.

1015
01:07:16,228 --> 01:07:18,162
Tell him exactly how I feel.

1016
01:07:20,432 --> 01:07:22,457
I'm not trying
to give you an argument.

1017
01:07:22,534 --> 01:07:24,866
There's nothing I can say
that you don't know.

1018
01:07:24,937 --> 01:07:28,395
It's important that you understand
just how wrong I think you...

1019
01:07:28,473 --> 01:07:30,941
I believe you're making the worst
mistake you've ever made in your...

1020
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:33,807
You're gonna regret it with more
bitterness that you've ever known...

1021
01:07:33,879 --> 01:07:35,506
for as long as you live.

1022
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:38,549
You're wrong.
You're as wrong as you can be.

1023
01:07:38,617 --> 01:07:40,983
Because I'm thinking of her
and even the doctor is going to know...

1024
01:07:41,053 --> 01:07:43,044
I'm thinking of her.

1025
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:45,055
There's something else.

1026
01:07:46,158 --> 01:07:48,285
I'm surprised
it hasn't occurred to you.

1027
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,419
The doctor will accept
whatever you say to him...

1028
01:07:50,495 --> 01:07:54,761
because he's a terribly sensitive man
and because he said he would.

1029
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,666
But Joey won't. The most obvious
mistake you're making...

1030
01:07:57,736 --> 01:08:00,261
is in underestimating
your own daughter.

1031
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:02,807
She'll fight you and
your whole attitude...

1032
01:08:02,874 --> 01:08:05,741
and everything you do and every
argument you ever try to give her.

1033
01:08:06,511 --> 01:08:08,536
And one thing more.

1034
01:08:08,613 --> 01:08:13,277
Until today, I would never have believed
that I could say such a thing...

1035
01:08:13,352 --> 01:08:15,479
but when she fights you...

1036
01:08:15,554 --> 01:08:17,488
and for what it may be worth...

1037
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:19,490
I'm going to be on her side.

1038
01:08:24,496 --> 01:08:27,761
I never believed I'd hear you
say a thing like that.

1039
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,695
- Can I get you another drink?
- No, thanks. I'll get it myself.

1040
01:08:42,214 --> 01:08:44,774
I wish we had more time.

1041
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:47,244
What, Mom?

1042
01:08:47,319 --> 01:08:51,722
I was going to ask Miss Drayton
how her father and mother reacted to...

1043
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:53,917
Yeah. I wanted to ask that too.

1044
01:08:53,992 --> 01:08:57,291
Please call me Joanna.
They were shaken, all right.

1045
01:08:57,362 --> 01:08:59,557
I don't think
I've ever seen them so surprised.

1046
01:08:59,631 --> 01:09:01,565
The thing that really shook them...

1047
01:09:01,633 --> 01:09:04,602
was that I wanted to marry anybody
they hadn't even heard about.

1048
01:09:04,669 --> 01:09:07,638
I can't blame them
for being sort of stunned by it all.

1049
01:09:07,706 --> 01:09:12,609
Well. Then you couldn't blame us if we
were a little stunned, too, could you?

1050
01:09:12,677 --> 01:09:15,441
I mean, I wouldn't appear unreasonable
if I suggested...

1051
01:09:15,514 --> 01:09:19,678
that the two of you were behaving like
a couple of escaped lunatics, would I?

1052
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:24,022
This whole thing...

1053
01:09:24,089 --> 01:09:26,080
happened so quickly...

1054
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:28,092
it's like trying to ride a rocket.

1055
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,186
We didn't plan it that way.
It just happened that way.

1056
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:35,256
It's a little hard on Joanna's folks and
I'm sure it's gonna be hard on you.

1057
01:09:36,768 --> 01:09:38,531
We've got one evening
to discuss it...

1058
01:09:38,603 --> 01:09:41,629
and if you have any objections,
you'd better raise them in a hurry...

1059
01:09:41,706 --> 01:09:45,039
because in exactly four hours
we're gonna be on that plane and gone.

1060
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:48,637
I don't think I could list
all my objections in four hours.

1061
01:09:48,713 --> 01:09:51,011
I think I'd need
more like eight hours.

1062
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:54,484
Well, you've only got four hours.

1063
01:09:54,553 --> 01:09:56,885
So you'll just have to talk
twice as fast.

1064
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:15,497
Hello, darling.
How are you?

1065
01:10:15,574 --> 01:10:17,838
Forgive me.
I am a little bit early.

1066
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:20,810
Ego absolvo te.
Come in.

1067
01:10:20,879 --> 01:10:24,508
I don't like to be
always repeating myself...

1068
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:27,017
but how long is it since
that I remarked that I thought...

1069
01:10:27,085 --> 01:10:31,419
that you were the loveliest woman
I have ever known?

1070
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:35,085
You know, there is a kind of envy
that is no way sinful.

1071
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,788
That's what I've always
had for Matt all these years.

1072
01:10:37,863 --> 01:10:42,527
- What can I give you to drink?
- Well, I like Scotch if...

1073
01:10:42,601 --> 01:10:45,434
- Are we drinking wine?
- Yes.

1074
01:10:45,504 --> 01:10:48,632
Oh. I'll have
a little drop of Scotch anyhow.

1075
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:51,574
Equal amount of soda, please.

1076
01:10:57,382 --> 01:10:59,213
Thank you.

1077
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,654
My dear, what's the matter?

1078
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:09,293
Sorry.

1079
01:11:09,361 --> 01:11:11,295
We're in trouble.

1080
01:11:12,364 --> 01:11:14,127
Mike...

1081
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:17,430
we're in terrible trouble,
terrible trouble.

1082
01:11:17,502 --> 01:11:20,300
John told us...
Matt and me...

1083
01:11:20,372 --> 01:11:22,670
that he wouldn't marry Joey
unless we could say...

1084
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:25,972
that we approved the marriage
with no reservations whatever.

1085
01:11:26,044 --> 01:11:28,410
Joey doesn't know
that he said that.

1086
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,711
Now she's suddenly decided to go
with him tonight. She has her tickets.

1087
01:11:31,783 --> 01:11:35,446
The two of them are on their way in
from the airport with John's parents...

1088
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,183
and neither of them knows
that Matt has decided...

1089
01:11:39,257 --> 01:11:40,315
Well.

1090
01:11:40,392 --> 01:11:43,327
Matt has decided
that he can't approve.

1091
01:11:43,395 --> 01:11:47,729
That's not true.
Please tell me it's not true.

1092
01:11:48,633 --> 01:11:51,067
- Where is Matt?
- He's upstairs changing. He's...

1093
01:11:52,971 --> 01:11:54,905
He's not himself.

1094
01:11:57,509 --> 01:11:59,568
Excuse me.

1095
01:11:59,644 --> 01:12:01,578
It's incredible!

1096
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:14,656
- Table all right?
- It's fine.

1097
01:12:14,726 --> 01:12:18,127
- Thank you.
- Miss Christina, what's gonna happen?

1098
01:12:19,397 --> 01:12:22,195
I don't know, Tillie.

1099
01:12:22,267 --> 01:12:26,897
You and Mr. Matt, you gonna put a stop
to this damn nonsense foolishness?

1100
01:12:28,573 --> 01:12:31,167
I don't want to put a stop
to anything.

1101
01:12:31,243 --> 01:12:32,733
He's a fine man.

1102
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:37,475
He's a wonderful man,
and Joey is very much in love with him.

1103
01:12:37,549 --> 01:12:40,882
And it isn't just
damn nonsense foolishness.

1104
01:12:40,952 --> 01:12:42,920
Well, I tell you, Miss Christina.

1105
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:46,924
The way you are talkin',
I don't understand nothin' no more.

1106
01:12:49,961 --> 01:12:52,794
Nobody understands nothin' no more.

1107
01:12:54,432 --> 01:12:57,731
No, I don't think you're butting
into something that doesn't concern...

1108
01:12:59,137 --> 01:13:01,435
Damn blast these lousy laundries.

1109
01:13:01,506 --> 01:13:03,440
I understand how you feel.

1110
01:13:03,508 --> 01:13:06,306
I understand how everybody feels.

1111
01:13:06,378 --> 01:13:09,006
But you have to
understand something too.

1112
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,412
They've boxed me
into a hell of a corner here.

1113
01:13:11,483 --> 01:13:13,917
And no matter what Christina says
or what you say...

1114
01:13:13,985 --> 01:13:16,419
I am not going to behave
irresponsibly.

1115
01:13:16,488 --> 01:13:20,151
I'm not gonna tell them they can't get
married. I don't have the right.

1116
01:13:20,225 --> 01:13:22,193
But they don't have the right
to come in here...

1117
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:24,751
and expect me to be happy
about something any normal man...

1118
01:13:24,829 --> 01:13:26,763
Oh, for God's sake!

1119
01:13:27,832 --> 01:13:30,300
You're on the point of destroying
all the happiness there is...

1120
01:13:30,368 --> 01:13:33,735
in one of the happiest families
I've ever known.

1121
01:13:33,805 --> 01:13:35,932
Have you any appreciation
at all for Christina...

1122
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:41,403
Have you any appreciation at all
of how that woman has behaved today?

1123
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:45,711
From the moment they walked in, she was
for it, as if there were no problems.

1124
01:13:45,784 --> 01:13:49,948
But there are no problems that Joey
and young Prentice don't know about.

1125
01:13:50,021 --> 01:13:53,752
Christina has more respect for Joey's
judgment than you have. I must say...

1126
01:13:53,825 --> 01:13:56,453
Oh, come off it!

1127
01:13:56,528 --> 01:14:00,294
If Joey came home with some fuzzy-wuzzy
and said "This is the man for me"...

1128
01:14:00,365 --> 01:14:03,266
Christina would say,
"Oh, really? How wonderful.

1129
01:14:03,335 --> 01:14:07,066
Where will we get enough roses
to fill the Rose Bowl?"

1130
01:14:07,138 --> 01:14:10,505
I'm trying to remember
where I've seen you so angry.

1131
01:14:10,575 --> 01:14:14,170
Oh, yes. When you took
nine shots on the seventh green.

1132
01:14:15,814 --> 01:14:17,782
Would you mind
getting the hell out of here?

1133
01:14:17,849 --> 01:14:20,477
I think I know why you're angry too.

1134
01:14:20,552 --> 01:14:23,180
Not with the doctor,
whom you obviously respect.

1135
01:14:23,254 --> 01:14:26,382
Not with Joey or Christina,
not even with me.

1136
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,517
You're angry with yourself.

1137
01:14:28,593 --> 01:14:30,584
You're a pontificating
old poop!

1138
01:14:30,662 --> 01:14:35,065
You're angry because all of a sudden,
and in a single day, you've been thrown.

1139
01:14:35,133 --> 01:14:38,796
You're the last man in the world I would
have expected to behave the way you are.

1140
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:41,703
You're not yourself.
You're off balance.

1141
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:44,139
You don't know who your are,
what you are or what you're doing.

1142
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:45,733
That's your trouble.

1143
01:14:45,810 --> 01:14:49,507
You've gone back on yourself, laddie,
and in your heart you know it.

1144
01:14:49,581 --> 01:14:52,812
Now, listen, there's a limit
to what I'll take, even from you.

1145
01:14:52,884 --> 01:14:57,719
For 30 years, there's been no man
I've admired or respected more.

1146
01:14:57,789 --> 01:14:59,950
You know that.

1147
01:15:00,024 --> 01:15:05,087
And for the first time in all
those 30 years, I feel sorry for you.

1148
01:15:05,163 --> 01:15:07,723
Damn it, that's enough!

1149
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:11,428
Are you really capable
of putting yourself in my position?

1150
01:15:11,503 --> 01:15:13,437
Unless you've got
some kids of your own...

1151
01:15:13,505 --> 01:15:15,837
hidden away somewhere
that haven't shown up in the record...

1152
01:15:15,907 --> 01:15:20,003
how can you possibly know how a father
would feel in a situation like this?

1153
01:15:20,078 --> 01:15:21,568
You don't know!

1154
01:15:21,646 --> 01:15:24,615
I happen to believe they wouldn't
have a dog's chance...

1155
01:15:24,682 --> 01:15:27,947
not in this country,
not in the whole, stinking world.

1156
01:15:28,019 --> 01:15:29,714
They are this country.

1157
01:15:29,788 --> 01:15:32,723
They'll change this stinking world.

1158
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:35,726
Yeah, sure. Fifty years, maybe,
or a hundred years.

1159
01:15:35,794 --> 01:15:38,729
But not in your lifetime.
Maybe not even in mine.

1160
01:15:38,797 --> 01:15:40,162
My dear friend...

1161
01:15:40,231 --> 01:15:44,395
I wish with all my heart
you could be restrained.

1162
01:15:44,469 --> 01:15:46,403
And if I were ten years younger...

1163
01:15:46,471 --> 01:15:48,939
to prevent you
from going downstairs...

1164
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:52,670
I believe I'd make some sort of effort
to wrestle you to the floor.

1165
01:15:52,744 --> 01:15:54,974
That'll be the day.

1166
01:15:58,316 --> 01:16:01,308
Is that the car?
Did you hear a car?

1167
01:16:06,357 --> 01:16:08,985
Mrs. Prentice,
I'm Christina Drayton.

1168
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,494
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Prentice?

1169
01:16:11,563 --> 01:16:13,963
I'm so pleased to meet you.
Come on in.

1170
01:16:14,032 --> 01:16:16,899
Let me take your coat and hat.
And yours?

1171
01:16:16,968 --> 01:16:18,401
Thank you.

1172
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:21,701
How good of you to come
all this long way to see us. Do go in.

1173
01:16:21,773 --> 01:16:24,503
What did Dad say? Did you tell him?
I'll bet he was shaken.

1174
01:16:24,576 --> 01:16:27,545
- It was a surprise.
- Does he want to talk to me?

1175
01:16:27,612 --> 01:16:31,378
Yes, I'm sure he does. Later.
Please come in.

1176
01:16:31,449 --> 01:16:34,384
May I get you a drink?
What would you like?

1177
01:16:34,452 --> 01:16:37,580
May I have some sherry, please?
What a lovely room.

1178
01:16:37,655 --> 01:16:40,249
Thank you. John, would you be bartender?
I'll have some sherry too.

1179
01:16:40,325 --> 01:16:42,793
- Of course.
- Shall we sit over here?

1180
01:16:42,861 --> 01:16:44,988
What will you have, Dad?
Bourbon?

1181
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:49,466
- Thank you.
- You have such a magnificent view.

1182
01:16:49,534 --> 01:16:52,935
Thank you. Please sit down.
Sit down, Mr. Prentice.

1183
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,940
Did you have a pleasant flight?

1184
01:17:01,012 --> 01:17:03,105
Very pleasant, thank you.

1185
01:17:03,181 --> 01:17:06,412
The view of the sunset
was breathtaking.

1186
01:17:06,484 --> 01:17:09,544
Only took forty minutes.
Four hundred miles.

1187
01:17:10,488 --> 01:17:12,319
It's incredible, isn't it?

1188
01:17:15,527 --> 01:17:18,655
My husband will be down directly,
I think.

1189
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:20,391
He's upstairs changing.

1190
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:23,093
And we have a friend of ours
who's coming to dinner with us.

1191
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:24,896
Monsignor Ryan.

1192
01:17:24,969 --> 01:17:26,800
I'm sure they�ll be down
in a minute.

1193
01:17:28,506 --> 01:17:29,939
- Thank you.
- Mom.

1194
01:17:30,008 --> 01:17:32,067
- Thank you.
- There you are, Dad.

1195
01:17:32,143 --> 01:17:34,611
Thanks, son.

1196
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:37,944
Are you Catholics?

1197
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:42,242
Well, no, we're not.

1198
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,413
I'm afraid we're
nothing in particular.

1199
01:17:44,489 --> 01:17:47,890
Monsignor Ryan just happens to be
a very old friend.

1200
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:51,725
Do you come often
to San Francisco?

1201
01:17:51,796 --> 01:17:54,128
I've got to talk to your father.

1202
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:55,665
There he is.

1203
01:17:56,968 --> 01:18:00,563
Dad, I'd like you to meet
Mr. And Mrs. Prentice.

1204
01:18:00,638 --> 01:18:03,334
- This is my father.
- Mrs. Prentice, nice to meet you.

1205
01:18:03,408 --> 01:18:06,377
- How do you do?
- Mr. Prentice, happy to meet you.

1206
01:18:06,444 --> 01:18:09,242
- How do you do?
- May I present Monsignor Ryan?

1207
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:11,680
- How do you do, ma'am?
- How do you do?

1208
01:18:11,749 --> 01:18:13,239
Glad to meet you, sir.

1209
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:15,013
- Are you and John tending bar?
- Yes.

1210
01:18:15,086 --> 01:18:17,020
The monsignor and I
are both drinking Scotch.

1211
01:18:17,088 --> 01:18:19,022
Coming up.

1212
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:21,024
Sit down.

1213
01:18:24,529 --> 01:18:25,518
Well.

1214
01:18:27,565 --> 01:18:29,897
Did you have a nice flight
from Los Angeles?

1215
01:18:29,968 --> 01:18:31,993
Oh, yes. Very nice flight.

1216
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,867
Only 40 minutes.

1217
01:18:35,773 --> 01:18:37,707
Only 40 minutes from Los Angeles.

1218
01:18:37,775 --> 01:18:40,073
- Terrifying.
- If you're going to talk about flying...

1219
01:18:40,144 --> 01:18:42,237
you could talk
about flying to Geneva...

1220
01:18:42,313 --> 01:18:44,247
because John and I
are hoping to persuade...

1221
01:18:44,315 --> 01:18:46,408
all of you to fly over
for the wedding.

1222
01:18:46,484 --> 01:18:50,079
Would anybody like to talk about that
before I go up and start packing?

1223
01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:56,189
I take it they've told you
all about their plans?

1224
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:59,752
Of course. It's only when you're
eloping that you keep it a secret.

1225
01:18:59,831 --> 01:19:01,890
I don't know about you,
Mr. Prentice...

1226
01:19:01,966 --> 01:19:05,766
but it seems to me that these two
are rushing it just a little bit.

1227
01:19:06,638 --> 01:19:09,129
It seemed that way to me too.

1228
01:19:10,008 --> 01:19:12,374
It seems like that to you too?

1229
01:19:12,443 --> 01:19:14,070
That's right.

1230
01:19:15,213 --> 01:19:17,511
I'm certainly relieved
to hear that.

1231
01:19:17,582 --> 01:19:20,779
I was beginning to think I was the only
one around here who had any...

1232
01:19:20,852 --> 01:19:23,946
I would like Mrs. Prentice
to see the view.

1233
01:19:24,022 --> 01:19:26,388
What the hell are you talking about?
What view?

1234
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:28,789
From the terrace.
Before it gets too cold.

1235
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:32,227
- Would you care to see the view?
- Oh, yes, thank you. I would.

1236
01:19:32,296 --> 01:19:34,821
Good. Excuse us.
Bring your drink with you.

1237
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:48,145
Have you had any chance
to speak privately with John?

1238
01:19:48,212 --> 01:19:49,873
Well, no.

1239
01:19:49,947 --> 01:19:52,643
Because it's important that
you understand what's happened here...

1240
01:19:52,717 --> 01:19:56,380
and what I'm terribly afraid
is going to happen.

1241
01:19:56,454 --> 01:20:01,187
May I explain the situation to you
or try to?

1242
01:20:01,259 --> 01:20:02,920
Yes, please.
I wish you would.

1243
01:20:02,994 --> 01:20:05,360
First, I have to ask you...

1244
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,695
Forgive my being so abrupt
and so direct.

1245
01:20:08,766 --> 01:20:12,429
Are you shocked
by the fact that John...

1246
01:20:12,503 --> 01:20:15,768
that your son is involved
with a white girl?

1247
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,308
Surprised.

1248
01:20:18,376 --> 01:20:21,038
It never happened before.

1249
01:20:21,112 --> 01:20:24,240
I guess it never occurred to me
that such a thing might happen.

1250
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:28,082
But it wouldn't be true
to say that I'm shocked.

1251
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,154
Are you?

1252
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:34,620
Well.

1253
01:20:34,692 --> 01:20:37,627
I think I was at first
this afternoon.

1254
01:20:38,696 --> 01:20:42,063
Because it came
as a complete surprise to us too.

1255
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:44,124
But now I know
how they feel about each other.

1256
01:20:44,202 --> 01:20:46,796
Joey's still very young...

1257
01:20:46,871 --> 01:20:48,805
but she's not a child.

1258
01:20:50,308 --> 01:20:52,276
And they're...

1259
01:20:52,343 --> 01:20:54,368
deeply in love
with each other.

1260
01:20:58,683 --> 01:21:01,379
Are you about to tell me...

1261
01:21:01,452 --> 01:21:05,115
that you'd be willing to approve
the marriage but your husband won't?

1262
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:07,123
Is that it?

1263
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:10,493
Yes, that's it.

1264
01:21:10,561 --> 01:21:12,495
My husband won't either.

1265
01:21:14,999 --> 01:21:17,968
I wish there were more time...

1266
01:21:18,035 --> 01:21:21,471
if only so that we could adjust
to the situation.

1267
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:24,975
But the way things are,
there just isn't any time.

1268
01:21:25,042 --> 01:21:29,172
If we're going to accept
the thing at all, it seems to me...

1269
01:21:29,247 --> 01:21:32,114
we'll have to trust
the two of them...

1270
01:21:32,183 --> 01:21:34,515
and accept that they know
what they're doing.

1271
01:21:35,586 --> 01:21:37,747
And, Mrs. Drayton...

1272
01:21:37,822 --> 01:21:40,347
my husband just won't do that.

1273
01:21:46,497 --> 01:21:49,091
They seem to be having
quite a conversation out there.

1274
01:21:50,568 --> 01:21:54,527
It might do no harm
if we could have a few words.

1275
01:21:54,605 --> 01:21:55,663
Yeah, sure.

1276
01:21:57,241 --> 01:22:00,005
We can go in my study.
Will you excuse us, please?

1277
01:22:12,456 --> 01:22:15,254
I'll have another drink
if you will, Doctor?

1278
01:22:20,164 --> 01:22:23,656
If you'll excuse me, I'll go up
and throw a few things together.

1279
01:22:23,734 --> 01:22:25,895
Like for the next ten years.

1280
01:22:35,179 --> 01:22:36,612
Mr. Drayton...

1281
01:22:38,416 --> 01:22:42,147
I don't know you at all, and
I certainly wouldn't want to offend you.

1282
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:44,154
But are you some kind of a nut?

1283
01:22:44,222 --> 01:22:48,625
Are you going to tell me that you
approve of what's been going on here?

1284
01:22:48,693 --> 01:22:51,355
- I wasn't going to tell you that at all.
- Because if you do...

1285
01:22:51,429 --> 01:22:54,421
You may be a big, successful
newspaper publisher...

1286
01:22:54,498 --> 01:22:56,898
and I'm nothing but
a pensioned-off mailman...

1287
01:22:56,968 --> 01:22:59,061
but you are right out of your mind.

1288
01:23:07,144 --> 01:23:10,636
I have a pretty good idea
of what my father is saying to him.

1289
01:23:12,416 --> 01:23:15,078
But I wish I knew...

1290
01:23:15,152 --> 01:23:18,144
You were talking with him upstairs.

1291
01:23:18,222 --> 01:23:21,419
Have you any idea what
Mr. Drayton is saying to my father?

1292
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,354
I can tell you one thing.
I was very sorry to hear...

1293
01:23:25,429 --> 01:23:28,728
that you intend
to withdraw from the situation...

1294
01:23:28,799 --> 01:23:31,893
if you encounter any opposition.

1295
01:23:46,684 --> 01:23:48,652
She's up there packing.

1296
01:23:51,989 --> 01:23:54,082
Your mother
would like to speak to you.

1297
01:24:00,464 --> 01:24:02,625
This is a mess.
Where's Joey?

1298
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,634
- She's upstairs, my dear.
- I'm going up.

1299
01:24:05,703 --> 01:24:07,864
Everything is ready
whenever you all are ready.

1300
01:24:07,939 --> 01:24:09,873
We're not ready, Tillie.

1301
01:24:12,076 --> 01:24:13,543
Well!

1302
01:24:13,611 --> 01:24:17,342
What you're saying is that you feel
practically the same as I do about this.

1303
01:24:17,415 --> 01:24:20,043
That's right.
But even so...

1304
01:24:20,117 --> 01:24:24,918
this is a hell of an unhappy situation
for both your son and my daughter.

1305
01:24:27,058 --> 01:24:30,152
I think it would be best
if you talked to John yourself.

1306
01:24:40,371 --> 01:24:42,305
I said that...

1307
01:24:42,373 --> 01:24:45,467
if they didn't approve,
there'd be no marriage.

1308
01:24:48,679 --> 01:24:50,613
I set the terms, Mama.

1309
01:24:50,681 --> 01:24:52,342
They don't disapprove.

1310
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:55,619
Only Mr. Drayton.

1311
01:24:55,686 --> 01:24:57,517
Are you sure?

1312
01:24:57,588 --> 01:25:01,046
She said she'd even drive
the two of you to the airport.

1313
01:25:06,263 --> 01:25:10,324
I've lived with your father
for almost 40 years.

1314
01:25:10,401 --> 01:25:12,130
God willing,
there'll be a lot more.

1315
01:25:14,405 --> 01:25:16,339
And even though...

1316
01:25:16,407 --> 01:25:19,843
I've only known about this situation
for one hour...

1317
01:25:20,911 --> 01:25:23,379
I feel the same way
Mrs. Drayton does.

1318
01:25:25,049 --> 01:25:28,109
She says Joanna
will never give you up.

1319
01:25:28,953 --> 01:25:30,443
I guess...

1320
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:33,786
it depends upon
how much you want her.

1321
01:25:35,259 --> 01:25:37,193
Want her?

1322
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:41,725
I want her, Mama.

1323
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,131
You know what it's been like for me
these past eight years?

1324
01:25:47,571 --> 01:25:50,301
I felt like I never wanted
anybody again.

1325
01:25:50,374 --> 01:25:53,104
But, Mama...

1326
01:25:54,478 --> 01:25:57,675
these last few days with her...

1327
01:25:57,748 --> 01:26:01,411
it's like I'm alive again
and it's marvelous.

1328
01:26:02,486 --> 01:26:04,420
Excuse me, Doctor.

1329
01:26:08,225 --> 01:26:10,785
Your father wants to talk to you.

1330
01:26:10,861 --> 01:26:12,988
- Does he?
- He's in my study.

1331
01:26:33,284 --> 01:26:35,218
I've been talking to your husband.

1332
01:26:35,286 --> 01:26:38,551
He seems pretty much upset
by all this.

1333
01:26:38,622 --> 01:26:40,783
I know.

1334
01:26:40,858 --> 01:26:43,156
Your wife says you are too.

1335
01:26:43,227 --> 01:26:46,890
Not upset, exactly.
It's a very difficult problem.

1336
01:26:48,666 --> 01:26:51,567
For whom?
For you and my husband?

1337
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:56,367
I think you'll solve your problem,
all right.

1338
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:59,273
All you have to do is tell them
you're against them.

1339
01:26:59,343 --> 01:27:00,469
That's all.

1340
01:27:00,544 --> 01:27:02,478
And you'll have no problem.

1341
01:27:05,049 --> 01:27:08,314
You're not going to tell me
you're happy about this relationship?

1342
01:27:09,587 --> 01:27:13,387
This is not a night
for talking about happiness.

1343
01:27:13,457 --> 01:27:15,425
This is an unhappy night.

1344
01:27:16,861 --> 01:27:20,524
You've been talking to Christina.
I know how she feels.

1345
01:27:20,598 --> 01:27:24,932
Can you imagine for one minute that
I want to see either one of them hurt?

1346
01:27:28,038 --> 01:27:31,132
No more than my husband does.

1347
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:33,972
But hurt they're going to be.

1348
01:27:35,746 --> 01:27:37,737
Worse than my husband knows.

1349
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,483
I think worse than you know too.

1350
01:27:44,455 --> 01:27:46,787
I tell you he's as much
against this thing as I am.

1351
01:27:46,857 --> 01:27:48,347
Maybe more!

1352
01:27:48,425 --> 01:27:50,791
Son, you've got to listen to me.

1353
01:27:50,861 --> 01:27:53,728
I'm not trying to tell you
how to live your life...

1354
01:27:53,797 --> 01:27:56,732
but you've never
made a mistake like this before.

1355
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,859
You've been nothin'
but a source of pride...

1356
01:27:58,936 --> 01:28:01,063
for me and your mother
your whole life.

1357
01:28:01,138 --> 01:28:03,197
But you don't know what you're doin'.

1358
01:28:03,274 --> 01:28:05,765
This affair here...
It all happened too fast.

1359
01:28:05,843 --> 01:28:07,777
You said so yourself.

1360
01:28:07,845 --> 01:28:10,279
But you've got to stop and think.

1361
01:28:10,347 --> 01:28:12,815
Have you thought what people
would say about you?

1362
01:28:12,883 --> 01:28:16,717
In 16 or 17 states you'd
be breakin' the law. You'd be criminals.

1363
01:28:16,787 --> 01:28:18,778
And say they changed the law.

1364
01:28:18,856 --> 01:28:21,757
That don't change
the way people feel about this thing.

1365
01:28:21,825 --> 01:28:24,760
For a man who all his life never
put a wrong foot anywhere...

1366
01:28:24,828 --> 01:28:26,352
you're way out of line!

1367
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:28,921
That's for me to decide, man.

1368
01:28:28,999 --> 01:28:32,093
- So just shut up and let me...
- You don't say that to me!

1369
01:28:32,169 --> 01:28:34,729
You haven't got the right to ever say
a thing like that to me.

1370
01:28:34,805 --> 01:28:36,932
Not after what I've been to you!

1371
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:39,168
And you know that,
and I know that.

1372
01:28:39,243 --> 01:28:41,643
Yeah, I know what you are
and what you've made of yourself.

1373
01:28:41,712 --> 01:28:45,512
But I worked my ass off to get the money
to buy you all the chances you had!

1374
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:49,917
You know how far
I carried that bag in 30 years?

1375
01:28:49,987 --> 01:28:52,353
75,000 miles.

1376
01:28:52,423 --> 01:28:55,859
And mowin' lawns in the dark so you
wouldn't have to be stokin' furnaces...

1377
01:28:55,926 --> 01:28:58,326
and could bear down on the books.

1378
01:28:59,363 --> 01:29:03,356
There were things your mother should
have had that she insisted go for you.

1379
01:29:03,434 --> 01:29:05,527
And I don't mean fancy things.

1380
01:29:05,603 --> 01:29:08,436
I mean a decent coat.
A lousy coat!

1381
01:29:08,505 --> 01:29:10,632
And you're gonna tell me
that means nothin' to you...

1382
01:29:10,708 --> 01:29:12,642
and you could
break your mother's heart?

1383
01:29:16,714 --> 01:29:20,172
What happens to men
when they grow old?

1384
01:29:21,685 --> 01:29:23,619
Why do they forget everything?

1385
01:29:24,855 --> 01:29:26,789
I believe...

1386
01:29:26,857 --> 01:29:30,554
those two young people
need each other...

1387
01:29:30,628 --> 01:29:33,893
like they need
the air to breathe in.

1388
01:29:33,964 --> 01:29:37,525
Anybody can see that
by just looking at them.

1389
01:29:38,702 --> 01:29:41,296
But you and my husband are...

1390
01:29:41,372 --> 01:29:44,569
You might as well be blind men.

1391
01:29:44,642 --> 01:29:47,668
You can only see
that they have a problem.

1392
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:52,813
But do you really know
what's happened to them?

1393
01:29:52,883 --> 01:29:54,817
How they feel about each other?

1394
01:29:57,421 --> 01:29:58,911
I believe...

1395
01:29:58,989 --> 01:30:01,924
that men grow old.

1396
01:30:01,992 --> 01:30:03,823
And when the...

1397
01:30:03,894 --> 01:30:07,762
When sexual things no longer matter
to them, they forget it all.

1398
01:30:09,066 --> 01:30:12,160
Forget what true passion is.

1399
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:17,769
If you ever felt what my son...

1400
01:30:20,277 --> 01:30:23,212
feels for your daughter,
you've forgotten everything about it.

1401
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,578
My husband too.

1402
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:27,617
You knew once...

1403
01:30:27,685 --> 01:30:29,619
but that was a long time ago.

1404
01:30:29,687 --> 01:30:31,621
Now the two of you don't know.

1405
01:30:32,423 --> 01:30:36,086
And the strange thing...

1406
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,185
for your wife and me...

1407
01:30:38,262 --> 01:30:42,631
is that you don't even remember.

1408
01:30:43,767 --> 01:30:45,667
If you did...

1409
01:30:45,736 --> 01:30:48,102
how could you do
what you are doing?

1410
01:30:54,878 --> 01:30:58,109
I don't care what your mother says.
Maybe she's gone haywire too.

1411
01:30:58,182 --> 01:30:59,843
This is between you and me.

1412
01:30:59,917 --> 01:31:02,351
That's the first thing you've said
that makes any sense...

1413
01:31:02,419 --> 01:31:03,977
because that's exactly where it's at.

1414
01:31:04,054 --> 01:31:06,682
- And what I mean to say is...
- You've said what you had to say.

1415
01:31:08,325 --> 01:31:10,259
You listen to me.

1416
01:31:13,764 --> 01:31:17,165
You say you don't want to tell me
how to live my life?

1417
01:31:17,234 --> 01:31:18,792
What do you think
you've been doing?

1418
01:31:18,869 --> 01:31:21,269
You tell me what rights I've got
or haven't got...

1419
01:31:21,338 --> 01:31:23,533
and what I owe to you
for what you've done for me.

1420
01:31:25,809 --> 01:31:27,936
Let me tell you something.

1421
01:31:28,011 --> 01:31:30,673
I owe you nothing.

1422
01:31:30,748 --> 01:31:33,114
If you carried that bag
a million miles...

1423
01:31:33,183 --> 01:31:36,016
you did what you
were supposed to do...

1424
01:31:36,086 --> 01:31:38,748
because you brought me
into this world...

1425
01:31:38,822 --> 01:31:41,347
and from that day you owed me...

1426
01:31:41,425 --> 01:31:44,019
everything you could ever do for me,
like I will owe my son...

1427
01:31:44,094 --> 01:31:45,459
if I ever have another.

1428
01:31:45,529 --> 01:31:48,157
But you don't own me.

1429
01:31:48,232 --> 01:31:51,599
You can't tell me when or where
I'm out of line...

1430
01:31:51,668 --> 01:31:55,001
or try to get me to live my life
according to your rules.

1431
01:31:55,072 --> 01:31:57,006
You don't even know
what I am, Dad.

1432
01:31:57,074 --> 01:32:01,306
You don't know who I am,
how I feel, what I think.

1433
01:32:01,378 --> 01:32:05,246
And if I tried to explain it the rest of
your life, you would never understand.

1434
01:32:06,316 --> 01:32:09,308
You are 30 years older than I am.

1435
01:32:09,386 --> 01:32:11,616
You and your whole lousy generation...

1436
01:32:11,688 --> 01:32:14,714
believes the way it was for you
is the way it's got to be!

1437
01:32:14,792 --> 01:32:17,852
And not until your whole generation
has lain down and died...

1438
01:32:17,928 --> 01:32:21,056
will the deadweight of you
be off our backs!

1439
01:32:21,131 --> 01:32:24,191
You understand?
You've got to get off my back.

1440
01:32:42,453 --> 01:32:44,387
Dad.

1441
01:32:51,195 --> 01:32:53,129
You're my father.

1442
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:56,530
I'm your son.
I love you.

1443
01:32:57,601 --> 01:33:00,434
I always have
and I always will.

1444
01:33:02,739 --> 01:33:05,708
But you think of yourself
as a colored man.

1445
01:33:07,311 --> 01:33:09,336
I think of myself...

1446
01:33:09,413 --> 01:33:11,347
as a man.

1447
01:33:17,354 --> 01:33:20,380
Now, I've got a decision to make.

1448
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:23,722
And I've got to make it alone.

1449
01:33:23,794 --> 01:33:25,728
And I gotta make it in a hurry.

1450
01:33:26,597 --> 01:33:28,531
So...

1451
01:33:29,967 --> 01:33:32,197
would you go out there...

1452
01:33:32,269 --> 01:33:34,203
and see after my mother?

1453
01:34:28,992 --> 01:34:32,086
You've just got to talk John's parents
into flying over with you.

1454
01:34:32,162 --> 01:34:34,130
It would mean so much to John
to have them there...

1455
01:34:34,197 --> 01:34:36,757
and I know they can afford it.

1456
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:40,064
You know, I think John's father
is gonna make it a bit rough for him.

1457
01:34:40,137 --> 01:34:43,903
Did you see his expression when he
walked off to have a talk with Dad?

1458
01:34:43,974 --> 01:34:45,839
But isn't she lovely?

1459
01:34:45,909 --> 01:34:48,343
- Don't you like her already?
- Yes, darling, I do.

1460
01:34:48,412 --> 01:34:50,073
She's a good one.

1461
01:34:50,147 --> 01:34:52,513
When John's father first saw
that I was a white girl...

1462
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:54,517
I thought he was going to faint.

1463
01:34:54,585 --> 01:34:56,849
What about your father?

1464
01:34:56,920 --> 01:35:00,048
Yes, that was funny, wasn't it?

1465
01:35:00,123 --> 01:35:03,524
Oh, Mom, isn't this thrilling?
Aren't you just...

1466
01:35:03,594 --> 01:35:05,858
Yes, darling, I am. Just.

1467
01:35:54,745 --> 01:35:57,646
I should be able to say something
to you, Mrs. Prentice.

1468
01:35:58,882 --> 01:36:03,342
In my trade, there are
a hundred clich� phrases of comfort...

1469
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:06,253
for every human condition.

1470
01:36:06,323 --> 01:36:09,918
But in the midst
of this heartbreaking distress...

1471
01:36:09,993 --> 01:36:11,961
I must admit...

1472
01:36:12,029 --> 01:36:14,020
I'm completely stumped.

1473
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:17,132
There's simply
nothing I could say.

1474
01:36:21,004 --> 01:36:23,029
Mary, you've just got to understand...

1475
01:36:23,106 --> 01:36:26,200
Please, John.
The monsignor is right.

1476
01:36:26,276 --> 01:36:28,210
Please say no more.

1477
01:36:50,467 --> 01:36:52,401
I'll be a son of a bitch.

1478
01:37:12,756 --> 01:37:14,690
Close the door, Mr. Drayton.

1479
01:37:25,135 --> 01:37:27,865
You didn't have the guts
to tell me face-to-face, did you?

1480
01:37:28,972 --> 01:37:31,805
Before you start telling me
how much guts I've got...

1481
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:35,276
I told you
I'd have something to say.

1482
01:37:35,345 --> 01:37:37,279
Now I'm ready to say it.

1483
01:37:39,116 --> 01:37:41,175
Are you gonna stay in here?

1484
01:37:56,433 --> 01:38:00,563
You know that I'm
completely sympathetic, don't you?

1485
01:38:00,637 --> 01:38:04,232
You know that I have
no reservations about anything.

1486
01:38:04,307 --> 01:38:07,640
And that whatever makes you happy
is my happiness too.

1487
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:09,645
Of course I know that.

1488
01:38:10,847 --> 01:38:14,078
Then listen to me, darling.

1489
01:38:14,151 --> 01:38:16,711
There's something
I have to tell you...

1490
01:38:16,787 --> 01:38:18,982
about this situation...

1491
01:38:19,055 --> 01:38:22,024
which you don't really...

1492
01:38:22,092 --> 01:38:23,286
What are you doing up there?

1493
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,488
Come on down here, both of you!

1494
01:38:28,398 --> 01:38:30,332
How about your glasses?

1495
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,460
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you.

1496
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:37,573
No, you've had
enough as it is already.

1497
01:38:37,641 --> 01:38:39,472
What's going on?

1498
01:38:39,543 --> 01:38:41,875
There's something I want to say
and I'd like you to sit down...

1499
01:38:41,945 --> 01:38:44,243
see if you can keep quiet
for once in your life.

1500
01:38:44,314 --> 01:38:46,407
Please, sit down, John.

1501
01:38:46,483 --> 01:38:48,417
Sit down, Chris, please.

1502
01:38:50,387 --> 01:38:53,788
I have a few things to say and
you might just think they're important.

1503
01:38:55,992 --> 01:38:59,553
This has been a strange day. I don't
think that's putting it too strongly.

1504
01:38:59,629 --> 01:39:02,393
I might even say
it's been an extraordinary day.

1505
01:39:03,733 --> 01:39:06,327
I've been out there
thinking about the day...

1506
01:39:06,403 --> 01:39:08,394
and the way it has gone...

1507
01:39:08,471 --> 01:39:11,463
and it seems to me that now...

1508
01:39:11,541 --> 01:39:15,272
I need to make a few
personal statements.

1509
01:39:15,345 --> 01:39:17,813
For a variety of reasons.

1510
01:39:21,918 --> 01:39:26,218
The day began for me when I walked into
this house and Tillie said to me...

1511
01:39:27,791 --> 01:39:28,849
Excuse me.

1512
01:39:30,126 --> 01:39:32,686
Tillie!
This'll only take a second.

1513
01:39:32,762 --> 01:39:35,424
- Everything's been ready for...
- I know.

1514
01:39:35,498 --> 01:39:37,432
All right. Sit down.

1515
01:39:38,668 --> 01:39:40,431
This is Miss Matilda Binks...

1516
01:39:40,503 --> 01:39:43,961
who's been a member of this family
for 22 years...

1517
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:47,168
and who today has been
making a great deal of trouble.

1518
01:39:47,244 --> 01:39:48,370
Sit down, Tillie.

1519
01:39:51,481 --> 01:39:56,248
Now. The minute I walked
into this house this afternoon...

1520
01:39:56,319 --> 01:40:01,552
Miss Binks said to me,
"Well, all hell's done broke loose now."

1521
01:40:01,625 --> 01:40:04,150
I asked her, naturally enough,
to what she referred...

1522
01:40:04,227 --> 01:40:06,559
and she said, "You'll see."

1523
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:08,257
And I did.

1524
01:40:09,332 --> 01:40:14,133
Then after some preliminary guessing
games, at which I was never very good...

1525
01:40:14,204 --> 01:40:17,196
it was explained to me
by my daughter...

1526
01:40:17,274 --> 01:40:19,674
that she intended to get married.

1527
01:40:19,743 --> 01:40:24,339
And that her intended was a young man
whom I had never met...

1528
01:40:24,414 --> 01:40:27,383
who happened to be a Negro.

1529
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:31,978
I think it's fair to say
that I responded to this news...

1530
01:40:32,055 --> 01:40:35,183
in the same manner that any
normal father would respond to it...

1531
01:40:35,258 --> 01:40:38,227
unless, of course, his daughter
happened to be a Negro too.

1532
01:40:40,363 --> 01:40:44,891
In a word, I was flabbergasted. And
while I was still being flabbergasted...

1533
01:40:44,968 --> 01:40:47,766
I was informed by my daughter...

1534
01:40:47,837 --> 01:40:49,862
a very determined young woman...

1535
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:51,999
much like her mother...

1536
01:40:52,075 --> 01:40:55,476
that the marriage was on...

1537
01:40:55,545 --> 01:40:58,446
no matter what her mother and I
might feel about it.

1538
01:41:00,517 --> 01:41:05,545
Then the next startling development
occurred when you walked in...

1539
01:41:05,622 --> 01:41:08,147
and said that unless we...
her mother and I...

1540
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:11,682
approved of the marriage,
there would be no marriage.

1541
01:41:11,761 --> 01:41:13,922
You didn't!
What a funny thing to do.

1542
01:41:17,267 --> 01:41:20,259
This may be the last chance
I'll ever have...

1543
01:41:20,337 --> 01:41:22,464
to tell you to do anything.

1544
01:41:22,539 --> 01:41:24,905
So I'm telling you
shut up.

1545
01:41:28,745 --> 01:41:30,770
Now.

1546
01:41:30,847 --> 01:41:34,977
It became clear that we had one
single day to make up our minds...

1547
01:41:35,051 --> 01:41:38,384
as to how we felt
about this whole situation.

1548
01:41:38,455 --> 01:41:39,717
So what happened?

1549
01:41:39,789 --> 01:41:42,053
My wife, typically enough...

1550
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:44,059
decided to simply ignore...

1551
01:41:44,127 --> 01:41:46,960
every practical aspect
of the situation...

1552
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:50,591
and was carried away
in some kind of romantic haze...

1553
01:41:50,667 --> 01:41:52,362
which made her, in my view...

1554
01:41:52,435 --> 01:41:56,166
totally inaccessible
to anything in the way of reason.

1555
01:41:59,142 --> 01:42:03,340
Now I have not as yet referred
to His Reverence...

1556
01:42:03,413 --> 01:42:06,940
who began by forcing his way
into the situation...

1557
01:42:07,017 --> 01:42:09,383
and then insulting my intelligence...,.

1558
01:42:09,452 --> 01:42:12,250
By mouthing 300 platitudes...

1559
01:42:12,322 --> 01:42:15,883
and ending just a half hour ago
by coming to my room...

1560
01:42:15,959 --> 01:42:19,486
and challenging me
to a wrestling match.

1561
01:42:19,562 --> 01:42:23,157
- What time is your plane?
- 10:45.

1562
01:42:24,234 --> 01:42:25,724
Right.

1563
01:42:25,802 --> 01:42:27,929
Now, Mr. Prentice...

1564
01:42:28,004 --> 01:42:30,472
clearly a most reasonable man...

1565
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:32,474
says he has no wish to offend me...

1566
01:42:32,542 --> 01:42:34,806
but wants to know
if I'm some kind of a nut.

1567
01:42:36,713 --> 01:42:38,647
And Mrs. Prentice says...

1568
01:42:38,715 --> 01:42:41,741
that like her husband,
I'm a burnt-out old shell of a man...

1569
01:42:41,818 --> 01:42:45,049
who cannot even
remember what it's like...

1570
01:42:45,121 --> 01:42:46,850
to love a woman...

1571
01:42:47,991 --> 01:42:50,858
the way her son loves my daughter.

1572
01:42:55,732 --> 01:42:57,825
And strange as it seems...

1573
01:42:59,669 --> 01:43:02,661
that's the first statement
made to me all day...

1574
01:43:02,739 --> 01:43:05,207
with which I am prepared
to take issue.

1575
01:43:08,545 --> 01:43:10,877
Because I think you're wrong.

1576
01:43:10,947 --> 01:43:13,381
You're as wrong as you can be.

1577
01:43:14,551 --> 01:43:18,385
I admit that I hadn't considered it,
hadn't even thought about it...

1578
01:43:18,455 --> 01:43:22,118
but I know exactly
how he feels about her.

1579
01:43:23,193 --> 01:43:25,923
And there is nothing,
absolutely nothing...

1580
01:43:25,995 --> 01:43:29,396
that your son feels
for my daughter...

1581
01:43:29,466 --> 01:43:31,798
that I didn't feel for Christina.

1582
01:43:34,437 --> 01:43:36,496
Old? Yes.

1583
01:43:36,573 --> 01:43:38,507
Burnt out? Certainly.

1584
01:43:39,642 --> 01:43:42,941
But I can tell you
the memories are still there...

1585
01:43:44,347 --> 01:43:48,010
clear, intact, indestructible.

1586
01:43:49,185 --> 01:43:52,245
And they'll be there
if I live to be 110.

1587
01:43:52,322 --> 01:43:55,018
Where John
made his mistake, I think...

1588
01:43:55,091 --> 01:43:58,754
was attaching so much importance
to what her mother and I might think.

1589
01:43:58,828 --> 01:44:03,959
Because in the final analysis,
it doesn't matter a damn what we think.

1590
01:44:04,033 --> 01:44:07,332
The only thing that matters
is what they feel...

1591
01:44:07,403 --> 01:44:10,065
and how much they feel...

1592
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:12,074
for each other.

1593
01:44:15,712 --> 01:44:18,044
And if it's half...

1594
01:44:18,114 --> 01:44:20,048
of what we felt...

1595
01:44:23,753 --> 01:44:25,778
that's everything.

1596
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:42,268
As for you two and
the problems you're going to have...

1597
01:44:42,338 --> 01:44:45,865
they seem almost unimaginable.

1598
01:44:45,942 --> 01:44:48,172
But you'll have no problem with me.

1599
01:44:49,546 --> 01:44:51,104
And I think...

1600
01:44:51,181 --> 01:44:54,014
that when Christina and I
and your mother...

1601
01:44:54,083 --> 01:44:56,074
have some time to work on him...

1602
01:44:56,152 --> 01:44:58,484
you'll have no problem
with your father.

1603
01:45:02,258 --> 01:45:05,625
But you do know...
I'm sure you know...

1604
01:45:05,695 --> 01:45:08,061
what you're up against.

1605
01:45:08,131 --> 01:45:11,589
There'll be a hundred million people
right here in this country...

1606
01:45:11,668 --> 01:45:13,829
who'll be shocked and offended...

1607
01:45:13,903 --> 01:45:16,565
and appalled at the two of you.

1608
01:45:18,808 --> 01:45:22,005
And the two of you will just
have to ride that out.

1609
01:45:22,078 --> 01:45:24,740
Maybe every day
for the rest of your lives.

1610
01:45:26,783 --> 01:45:30,014
You can try to ignore those people...

1611
01:45:30,086 --> 01:45:33,214
or you can feel sorry for them
and for their prejudices...

1612
01:45:33,289 --> 01:45:38,488
and their bigotry and
their blind hatreds and stupid fears.

1613
01:45:38,561 --> 01:45:40,495
But where necessary...

1614
01:45:40,563 --> 01:45:44,260
you'll just have
to cling tight to each other...

1615
01:45:44,334 --> 01:45:47,326
and say screw all those people!

1616
01:45:48,404 --> 01:45:53,000
Anybody could make a hell of a
good case against your getting married.

1617
01:45:53,910 --> 01:45:57,107
The arguments are so obvious
that nobody has to make them.

1618
01:45:58,581 --> 01:46:00,515
But you're two wonderful people...

1619
01:46:02,452 --> 01:46:04,420
who happened to fall in love...

1620
01:46:05,788 --> 01:46:09,053
and happen to have
a pigmentation problem.

1621
01:46:09,993 --> 01:46:12,359
And I think that now...

1622
01:46:12,428 --> 01:46:14,726
no matter what kind of a case
some bastard could make...

1623
01:46:14,797 --> 01:46:16,731
against your getting married...

1624
01:46:16,799 --> 01:46:18,733
there would be only one thing worse.

1625
01:46:20,236 --> 01:46:22,761
And that would be if...

1626
01:46:22,839 --> 01:46:25,069
knowing what you two are...

1627
01:46:25,141 --> 01:46:27,371
knowing what you two have...

1628
01:46:27,443 --> 01:46:30,640
and knowing what you two feel...

1629
01:46:30,713 --> 01:46:32,908
you didn't get married.

1630
01:46:53,803 --> 01:46:56,499
Well, Tillie, when the hell
are we gonna get some dinner?
