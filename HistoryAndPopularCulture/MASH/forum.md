Hello everyone,

I am for Daniel's idea that the racism in this movie is on purpose. As it is the time when women were fighting for their equality and rights, the director will not add discrimination scene in to a movie without a reason. In my opinion, these scenes are used to show the chaotic and reasonless atmosphere in the MASH, and the atmosphere of the MASH reflects the U.S. during the war.

I think that the movie reflects to the following ideas: 

1. People who are not in the front do not know the cruelty of war.

In both Korean War and Vietnam War, many soldiers died in frontline as well as many civilians. As the movie shows, many injured soldiers were sent to the hospital. On the other side, people in the back can not feel the sacrifice in frontline. In the movie, the back means the MASH. The MASH in the movie is a place far from the front, no one really cares about the war. People in MASH can hardly feel the pain of war: they just make love and play soccer. And I think it also suggests that the decision-makers (and those who are far away from the war) in real world can not feel the pain of war themselves? 

2. People in this war do not know what it is for. They were driven blindly into this war and were doing crazy things.

As the people in MASH do in the movie, they do not care about the war. What they are doing is just dawdling. There is no courage or sacrifice shown in the movie. The characters' actions in the movie are just as naive as playing house.

Therefore, I like Lauren's idea that "by making the soldiers immature, it makes the environment of the war unprofessional". This movie tries to the decrease the seriousness of war and make people to think about the reason of the war.

(I have to say this movie is quite hard to understand. Overlapped conversations and exaggerated plots make it hard to get what the director is trying to convey.)

I am still wondering about the females in this movie. I think the director uses the discrimination against women in MASH to 
collapse the seriousness of war, as well as to show the foolishness of the war. What do you think? Any other ways to explain the females in this movie?
