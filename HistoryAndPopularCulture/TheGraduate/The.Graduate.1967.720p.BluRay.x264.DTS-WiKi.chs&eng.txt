我丈夫很晚才回来的
My husband will be back quite late.

00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:33,076
我不希望会发生那种事情
I mean, you didn't really think I'd do something like that.

162
00:12:33,147 --> 00:12:34,512
怎样的事情？

罗宾森太太你想引诱我
Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me.

00:12:57,938 --> 00:12:59,906

Will you forgive me for what I just said?

175
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:05,268

00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:07,175

I don't think of you that way, but I' m mixed up.

180
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:15,982
没事的喝酒吧
It's all right. Finish your drink.

181
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:17,853
罗宾森太太 我那样说你真的很不该
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.

182
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,256
很快就会忘记的喝酒吧
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.

183
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:23,659

你看过伊琳的肖像画吗？
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?

伊琳是个很吸引人的女孩 是吗？
Elaine certainly is an attractive girl, isn't she?

191
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:57,061
我忘记了她的眼睛是棕色的
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.

What are you so scared of?

207
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:39,467
我没有害怕罗宾森太太
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

208
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,167
那你为什么要跑？
Then why do you keep running away?

209
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:44,039
你就要睡觉了我不应该逗留
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.

如果那样？
What if he did?

214
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:54,714
那样就很有趣了不是吗？
It would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?

215
00:14:54,788 --> 00:14:56,312
你认为他不相信我们吗？
Don't you think he'd trust us together?

216
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:57,458
他当然相信
Of course, he does,

217
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,085
但是他也会想到别的 任何人都会
but he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.

218
00:14:59,193 --> 00:15:02,424
我不明白我比你大一倍 他们怎么会想...
I don't see why. I' m twice as old as you. How could anyone think...

219
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:04,226
会的你不知道吗？
They would, don't you see?

The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious.

我...我就站在这里？
Shall I... I mean, should I just stand here?

483
00:35:43,436 --> 00:35:45,495
我知道你想我做什么
I mean, I don't know what you want me to do.

484
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:48,136
- 为什么不看着呢？ - 噢是的谢谢
-  Why don't you watch? -  Oh, sure. Thank you.

班在黑暗里你会好过些 对吗？
Benjamin, would this be easier for you in the dark?

496
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:57,476
罗宾森太太我不能这样做
Mrs. Robinson, I can't do this.

497
00:36:57,576 --> 00:36:59,407
- 你什么？- 这样太不应该了
-  You what? -  This is all terribly wrong.

498
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:02,444
- 你觉得我不吸引你吗？ - 噢不是罗宾森太太
-  Do you find me undesirable? -  Oh, no, Mrs. Robinson.

499
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,314
我觉得你是我父母的朋友中 最吸引人的一个了
I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends.

500
00:37:05,384 --> 00:37:07,648
是真的你很吸引人但我...
I mean that. I find you desirable, but I...

501
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,184
能想象到我父母会怎样吗？
For god's sake, can you imagine my parents?

502
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:12,951
如果他们看到 我们在这里会怎么样呢？
Can you imagine what they'd say if they just saw us here in this room right now?

503
00:37:13,092 --> 00:37:15,458
- 他们会说什么？ - 我不知道罗宾森太太
-  What would they say? -  I have no idea, Mrs. Robinson,

504
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,052
但是
but for god's sake.

505
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:18,925
他们培育我的 给了我很好的生活
They brought me up. They made a good life for me,

506
00:37:18,998 --> 00:37:20,932
我想他们不应该看到这样
and I think they deserve better than this.

507
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,992
他们不应该发现 自己搭档的妻子在这床上
I think they deserve a little better than jumping into bed with the partner's wife.

508
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:25,367
你害怕我吗？
Are you afraid of me?

509
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:27,905
噢不是你误解了其实...
Oh, no, you're missing the point. Look...

510
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,532
我们可以一起做些别的事情
Maybe we could do something else together.

511
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:33,411
罗宾森太太 我们去看电影好吗？
Mrs. Robinson, would you like to go to a movie?

512
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:38,110
可以问你一个私人问题吗？
Can I ask you a personal question?

513
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:40,378
- 问什么都可以 - 这是你的第一次吗？
-  Ask me anything you want. -  Is this your first time?

514
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,450
- 是什么？- 是的对吧？
-  Is this what? -  It is, isn't it?

515
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:43,852
这是你的第一次
It is your first time.

516
00:37:43,956 --> 00:37:46,618
这真的很好笑罗宾森太太
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh.

517
00:37:47,026 --> 00:37:49,460
- 你可以承认的对吗？ - 你在开玩笑吗？
-  You can admit that, can't you? -  Are you kidding?

518
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,189
没什么要觉得羞愧的
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

519
00:37:51,263 --> 00:37:52,594
- 等一等 - 你的第一次...
-  Wait a minute. -  On your first time...

520
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:54,394
谁说这是我的第一次？
Who said it was my first time? Wait a minute.

521
00:37:54,466 --> 00:37:56,559
是因为你很不自然
Just because you happen to be inadequate.

522
00:37:56,635 --> 00:37:58,034
很不自然？
Inadequate?

523
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:04,242
- 我应该...- 别动！
-  Well, I guess I better... -  Don't move!

524
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,532
班你在做什么？
Ben, what are you doing?

525
00:43:07,546 --> 00:43:12,745
我只是在池里漂浮
Well, I would say that I' m just drifting here in the pool

526
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:14,216
为什么？
Why?

527
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:17,878
这样漂浮很舒服啊
Well, it's very comfortable just to drift here.

528
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,392
你想过研究所的事情吗？
Have you thought about graduate school

529
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,722
没有
No.

530
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:26,558
那你在大学苦读四年 是为了什么？
Would you mind telling me what those 4 years of college were for?

531
00:43:26,598 --> 00:43:28,930
那些努力是为了什么？
What was the point of all that hard work?

532
00:43:29,101 --> 00:43:30,432
你难到我了
You got me.

533
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:32,196
听我说班...
Now, listen, Ben...

534
00:43:34,173 --> 00:43:35,504
其实
Look.

535
00:43:36,475 --> 00:43:39,035
我觉得在付出努力
I think it's a very good thing that a young man,

536
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,579
成为一个年轻有为的人之后
after he's done some very good work,

537
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,338
是应该给自己一个机会
should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself

538
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:48,216
放松一下
and lie around and drink beer and so on.

539
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:51,151
但在几个星期之后
But after a few weeks,

540
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:55,789
我想那年轻人也应该收拾心情
I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation

541
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:58,624
开始做些正经事了
and start to think about getting off his ass.

542
00:43:59,398 --> 00:44:01,559
罗宾森夫妇来了
Robinsons are here.

543
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:07,496
你好啊班 这些日子在做什么啊？
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?

544
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:09,506
噢没做什么
Oh, not too much.

545
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:11,400
放松一下
Taking it easy.

546
00:44:12,544 --> 00:44:15,411
那是我觉得应该做的 没什么不妥
That's what I' d do if I could. Nothing wrong with that.

547
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:19,213
对了班伊琳很快就要回来了
Hey, Ben. Elaine's coming down from berkeley soon.

548
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:21,115
这次你去约她吧
I want you to call her up this time.

549
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,517
我会的
I will.

550
00:44:22,621 --> 00:44:25,556
我想你们一定很适合对方的
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.

551
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:28,857
向罗宾森太太问好啊班
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.

00:44:57,889 --> 00:45:00,016
亲爱的 我想问你一些事情但...
Darling, I' m going to ask you something, but you...

558
00:45:00,092 --> 00:45:02,890
如果你不想的话 可以不用回答我的
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

559
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:04,522
什么？
What?

560
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:09,263
我想问你最近晚上 出去外面做什么
Well, I' m going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.

561
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:12,095
出去外面？
When I go off?

562
00:45:13,472 --> 00:45:15,167
你不想的话可以不用回答我
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

563
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:17,274
不我会回答你的
No, I do. I want to tell you.

564
00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:20,174
我只是驾车到处逛
I drive around.

565
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,272
- 没其他了？- 没有了
-  What else? -  Nothing else.

566
00:45:24,082 --> 00:45:26,983
你不会一直开车逛 到下一天早上才回家的班
You don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.

567
00:45:27,085 --> 00:45:28,416
噢不会
Oh, no.

568
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:29,784
那你做什么？
Well, then, what do you do?

569
00:45:30,722 --> 00:45:32,053
和某人约会？
You meet someone?

570
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,623
约会？
Meet someone?

571
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:36,090
- 为什么这样说？ - 那是你的私事
-  Why do you say that? -  Well, this is your business.

572
00:45:36,295 --> 00:45:38,729
- 我不想这样说了- 等等
-  I won't play games with you. -  Wait, wait.

573
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:42,028
我没有和别人约会 但你为什么这样问我？
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why do you say that?

574
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:45,626
班我不想干扰你的私事
Benjamin, I don't want to pry into your affairs,

575
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:48,832
但我觉得你说的话很不诚实
but I would rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest.

576
00:45:49,308 --> 00:45:50,900
- 晚安- 但是...
-  Good night. -  Well, wait...

577

罗宾森太太 这次我们先说几句再开始好吗？
Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?

580
00:46:04,523 --> 00:46:06,821
我想我们之间没什么好说的
I don't think we have much to say to each other.

581
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:15,960
这些月以来我们做的 就只是来这里上床睡觉
Look, for months, all we've done is come up here and leap into bed together.

582
00:46:16,535 --> 00:46:18,127
你厌倦了吗？
Are you tired of it?

583
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:20,066
不我不是
I'm not, no.

584
00:46:20,238 --> 00:46:23,571
但你不觉得我们应该 改变一下气氛吗？
But do you think we could liven it up with a little conversation for a change?

585
00:46:23,642 --> 00:46:25,166
你到底想说什么？
What do you want to talk about?

586
00:46:25,277 --> 00:46:27,370
什么都可以
Anything. Anything at all.

587
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:31,013
你想说一下 你在大学时的经历吗？
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?

588
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:32,807
噢天啊
Oh, my god.

589
00:46:37,189 --> 00:46:38,816
想别的话题吧
Think of another topic.

590
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,191
艺术怎么样？
How about art?

591
00:46:50,669 --> 00:46:52,694
艺术这是个很好的话题
Art. That's a good subject.

592
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:54,204
你开头吧
You start it off.

593
00:46:54,373 --> 00:46:56,637
你开头吧我一点也不懂
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.

594
00:46:56,975 --> 00:46:58,636
那你想知道些什么？
Well, what do you want to know about it?

595
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,438
你喜欢现代艺术 还是古典艺术？
Are you interested more in modern art or in classical art?

596
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,942
两个都不喜欢
Neither.

597
00:47:03,014 --> 00:47:04,538
- 你对艺术没有兴趣？- 没有
-  You're not interested in art? -  No.

598
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:05,981
那你为什么想说艺术？
Then why do you want to talk about it?

599
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:07,073
我不想的
I don't.

600
00:47:07,185 --> 00:47:09,745
我们要做的是找些话题 交谈一下
Now, look, we're going to do this thing. We're going to have a conversation.

601
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:11,888
告诉我你今天做了些什么吧
Tell me what you did today.

602

I got up.

- 帮我丈夫做早餐- 对了

604
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:22,823
我们可以说一下你丈夫的事情
There's something we could have a conversation about... your husband.

605
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,568
噢他
Oh. Him.

606
00:47:24,603 --> 00:47:26,400
什么都可以
I mean, everything.

607
00:47:26,538 --> 00:47:29,029
我不知道你是怎么应付过来的
I don't know anything about how you work this.

608
00:47:29,307 --> 00:47:31,241
你晚上离开的时候是 怎样和他说的？
What do you say to him when you leave the house at night?

609
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:32,833
没什么他睡着了
Nothing. He's asleep.

610
00:47:32,944 --> 00:47:34,275
每次都是？
Always?

611
00:47:34,513 --> 00:47:36,105
你回来的时候不会吵醒他？
Doesn't he wake up when you come home?

612
00:47:38,216 --> 00:47:40,207
我们有不同的卧室
We have separate bedrooms.

613
00:47:40,252 --> 00:47:41,719
噢是这样
Oh, I see.

614
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,883
所以...
So you don't...

615
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:47,985
我不是想多管闲事 但你们似乎不是一起睡觉的
I don't like to seem like I' m prying, but I guess you don't sleep together.

616
00:47:48,427 --> 00:47:49,826
是的
No, we don't.

617
00:47:50,228 --> 00:47:51,718
这样有多久了？
How long has this been going on?

618
00:47:51,763 --> 00:47:53,788
- 好了别说这个了- 等一等
-  For god's sake, let's drop this. -  Wait a minute.

619
00:47:53,965 --> 00:47:55,296
你为什么嫁给他？
Why did you marry him?

620
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:57,400
看你能不能猜到了
See if you can guess.

621
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:59,098
我猜不到
Well, I can't.

622
00:47:59,438 --> 00:48:01,406
认真想想吧班
Think real hard, Benjamin.

623
00:48:01,973 --> 00:48:03,736
我不知道为什么除非...
I can't see why you did, unless...

624
00:48:04,776 --> 00:48:06,971
你是不得以才嫁给他的对吗？
You didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?

625
00:48:15,554 --> 00:48:17,021
不要告诉伊琳
Don't tell Elaine.

626
00:48:17,456 --> 00:48:20,084
噢你嫁给他是因为你怀孕了
Oh, no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant.

627
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:21,956
你很震惊吗？
Are you shocked?

628
00:48:24,262 --> 00:48:26,662
我从来没想到罗宾森先生 和你是那种...
I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...

629
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:29,360
好了我们睡觉吧
All right now, let's get to bed.

630
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:31,164
等等
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

631
00:48:32,671 --> 00:48:33,729
那是怎样发生的？
So how did it happen?

632
00:48:34,606 --> 00:48:36,631
- 什么？- 你和罗宾森先生
-  What? -  You and Mr. Robinson.

633
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:39,300
你想告诉我当时的情况吗？
Do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?

634
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:41,640
不是特别想
Not particularly.

635
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,013
- 他那时是读法律的吗？ - 是的
-  Was he a law student at the time? -  Mm- hmm.

636
00:48:45,584 --> 00:48:48,144
- 你那时也是学生吗？- 是的
-  And you were a student also? -  Mm- hmm.

637
00:48:49,488 --> 00:48:50,853
在大学？
At college?

638
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:52,879
是的
Yes.

639
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:54,787
你主修什么？
What was your major?

640
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,090
班为什么你要问这些问题？
Benjamin, why are you asking me all these questions?

641
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,498
因为我想知道啊罗宾森太太
Because I' m interested, Mrs. Robinson.

642
00:49:04,636 --> 00:49:06,900
你读大学时主修什么？
What was your major subject at college?

643
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:11,204
- 艺术- 艺术？
-  Art. -  Art?

644
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:15,209
我还以为你...
But I thought you...

645
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:23,847
我看这些年来 你已经对它失去兴趣了吧
I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years, then.

646
00:49:25,524 --> 00:49:26,821
应该是吧
Kind of.

647
00:49:29,227 --> 00:49:30,660
那是怎样发生的？
Well, how did it happen?

648
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:34,095
- 什么？- 你和罗宾森先生
-  What? -  You and Mr. Robinson.

649
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:36,232
你认为呢？
How do you think?

650
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:38,359
你带他来这个房间的吗？
Did you take you up to his room with him?

651
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:39,767
你们去酒店的吗？
Did you go to a hotel

652
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:42,135
噢班那有什么重要的吗？
Oh, Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?

653
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,468
我很好奇
I'm curious.

654
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:46,840
- 我们上了他的车- 噢不
-  We'd go to his car. -  Oh, no.

655
00:49:47,345 --> 00:49:48,778
你们在车上做的？
In the car you did it?

656
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:50,805
我想我们不是第一个这样的
Well, I don't think we were the first.

657
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:52,714
那是什么车？
What kind of car was it?

658
00:49:54,853 --> 00:49:56,013
什么？
What?

659
00:49:56,555 --> 00:49:58,250
还记得那是什么车吗？
Do you remember the make of the car?

660
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,515
- 噢天啊- 我真的想知道
-  Oh, my god. -  Really, I want to know.

661
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:03,628
是福特班
It was a ford, Benjamin.

662
00:50:03,695 --> 00:50:05,162
福特
A ford.

663
00:50:05,397 --> 00:50:09,800
福特该死的很不错啊
A ford. God damn it, that's great. A ford.

664
00:50:10,669 --> 00:50:12,227
够了
That's enough.

665
00:50:15,407 --> 00:50:19,173
那伊琳就是在一辆 福特里开始的咯
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a ford.

666
00:50:20,412 --> 00:50:22,209
不要说伊琳
Don't talk about Elaine.

667
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:23,906
不要说伊琳？
Don't talk about Elaine?

668
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:25,576
是的
No.

669
00:50:26,184 --> 00:50:27,742
为什么？
Why not?

670
00:50:28,186 --> 00:50:29,778
因为我不想你说她
Because I don't want you to.

671
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,421
为什么呢？
Well, why don't you?

672
00:50:31,723 --> 00:50:33,281
我想你来告诉我
I wish you'd tell me.

673
00:50:33,425 --> 00:50:34,915
没什么好说的
There's nothing to tell.

674
00:50:35,193 --> 00:50:37,684
为什么一说起她 就紧张起来呢？
Well, why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?

675
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:43,301
看来我要约伊琳出来问清楚咯
Well, I guess I' II have to ask her out on a date and find out what the big deal is.

676
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:47,203
班你不许和她约会
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.

677
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:48,738
明白了吗？
Do you understand that?

678
00:50:48,907 --> 00:50:50,932
我无意约她出来的
I have no intention of taking her out.

679
00:50:53,812 --> 00:50:55,211
好
Good.

680
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:57,811
我只是开个玩笑
I was just kidding around.

681
00:51:00,552 --> 00:51:02,019
好
Good.

682
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:04,652
为什么？
Well, why shouldn't I

683
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,125
- 我有我的原因 - 那就说出来吧
-  I have my reasons. -  Then let's hear them.

684
00:51:11,229 --> 00:51:12,287
不行
No.

685
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:15,026
说出来吧我知道是为什么
Let's hear them, Mrs. Robinson, because I think I know what they are.

686
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:17,899
我配不上和她有联系？
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I

687
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:20,333
我也配不上说起她对吗？
I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I

688
00:51:20,472 --> 00:51:22,440
- 不要再说了- 不说不行
-  Let's drop it. -  We're not dropping it.

689
00:51:22,474 --> 00:51:25,238
我配得上你 但配不起和你女儿有联系
I'm good enough for you, but I' m not good enough to associate with your daughter.

690
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:26,935
- 就是这样是吗？- 班
-  That's it, isn't it? -  Benjamin.

691
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:28,512
是吗？
Isn't it?

692
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:42,456
是的
Yes.

693
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:46,353
你真的很可恶罗宾森太太
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson.

694
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:48,054
你以为我引以为荣吗？
Do you think I' m proud of myself?

695
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,724
- 你以为我为这种事骄傲吗？ - 我不知道
-  Do you think I' m proud of this? -  I wouldn't know.

696
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:51,325
我不是的
Well, I am not.

697
00:51:51,603 --> 00:51:53,002
我也不是
No, sir.

698
00:51:53,304 --> 00:51:56,569
我不该浪费自己的青春 在一个心碎了的酒鬼身上
I'm not proud that I spend my time with a broken- down alcoholic.

699
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:58,672
我明白了
I see.

700
00:51:58,777 --> 00:52:02,474
如果你以为我是因为寂寞 才来找你就大错特错了
If you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom than you're all wrong.

701
00:52:02,714 --> 00:52:04,341
那是因为罗宾森太太
'Cause, Mrs. Robinson,

702
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:07,176
这是我做过的 最令自己恶心的事情
this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me.

703
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:09,876
你做到了你想做的事 但我却在受罪
You do what you want, but I' m getting the hell out.

704
00:52:10,488 --> 00:52:11,750
是吗？
Are you?

705
00:52:11,823 --> 00:52:13,017
当然是了
Goddamn right, I am.

706
00:52:16,294 --> 00:52:19,525
你是这样看我的吗？ 我是那么令你讨厌的吗？
That's how you feel about me? That I' m a sick and disgusting person?

707
00:52:19,631 --> 00:52:21,929
- 别开始- 什么？
-  Now, don't start this. -  What?

708
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,031
别开始扮作伤心
Don't start acting hurt.

709
00:52:24,202 --> 00:52:26,227
你不希望我会有一点伤心吗？
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?

710
00:52:26,337 --> 00:52:30,000
你说的对我配不上你女儿
Mrs. Robinson, you lie there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.

711
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:31,599
我有那样说吗？
Did I say that?

712
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,502
你的意思是这样
In so many words.

713
00:52:34,312 --> 00:52:38,908
班很抱歉我给你留下 那么差的印象
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.

714
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:41,952
两分钟前你还说 我配不上你女儿
Well, 2 minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter.

715
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,454
现在你又给我道歉
Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.

716
00:52:44,522 --> 00:52:46,183
我无意的
I didn't mean it.

717
00:52:46,324 --> 00:52:48,519
我认为你们是合不来的
I don't think you'd be right for each other.

718
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:52,253
但我不认为你比不上她
I'd never say you aren't as good a person as she is.

719
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:54,689
真的？
You wouldn't?

720
00:52:55,834 --> 00:52:57,597
当然是了
Of course I wouldn't.

721
00:53:02,073 --> 00:53:03,563
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

722
00:53:03,675 --> 00:53:07,202
很明显你不希望我再烦着你了
Well, it's pretty obvious you don't want me around anymore.

723
00:53:09,347 --> 00:53:11,178
其实...
Well, look, uh...

724
00:53:13,852 --> 00:53:15,786
刚才我有点不知所措
I was kind of upset there.

725
00:53:17,288 --> 00:53:19,188
我为我说的话道歉
I'm sorry I said those things.

726
00:53:19,758 --> 00:53:21,191
没关系
It's all right.

727
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,192
我知道自己为什么如此让你讨厌
I think I can understand why I' m disgusting to you.

728
00:53:25,096 --> 00:53:26,461
噢不
Oh, no.

729
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:31,897
我喜欢你的不然我不会来这里
Look, I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.

730
00:53:32,604 --> 00:53:34,595
那不是令你很难受的吗？
But if it's sickening for you?

731
00:53:34,773 --> 00:53:36,104
不是
It's not.

732
00:53:39,277 --> 00:53:43,111
我很享受也很盼望 那是我唯一想去做的
I enjoy it. I look forward to it. It 's the one thing I have to look forward to.

733
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:47,048
你不必这样说
You don't have to say that.

734
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:48,812
我不应该...
Well, I wouldn't.

735
00:53:48,987 --> 00:53:51,251
我不应该说那些话的
I would never say it if it wasn't true.

736
00:53:51,923 --> 00:53:53,481
那我可以留下来吗？
May I stay, then?

737
00:53:56,094 --> 00:53:58,289
可以我想你留下来
Yes, please. I want you to.

738
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:01,127
- 谢谢- 不必谢我
-  Thank you. -  Well, don't.

739
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,124
是我想你这样做的
Thank me, because I want you to.

740
00:54:05,904 --> 00:54:08,031
你能答应我不和伊琳约会吗？
But you won't ever take Elaine out, will you?

741
00:54:08,106 --> 00:54:09,801
我想你作出承诺
I want you to promise me that.

742
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:12,432
为什么要这样呢？
Look, why the hell did you bring this up?

743
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,068
我不会和她约会的
It never occurred to me to take her out.

744
00:54:14,145 --> 00:54:15,737
那就保证你不会吧！
Then give me your word you won't!

745
00:54:16,815 --> 00:54:18,510
真有点荒唐
This is absurd.

746
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,811
答应我班
Promise me, Benjamin.

747
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,447
好了我答应
All right, I promise.

748
00:54:23,521 --> 00:54:26,718
我答应你不和 伊琳.罗宾森约会
For christ's sake, I promise I'll never take out Elaine Robinson.

749
00:54:29,127 --> 00:54:30,617
谢谢
Thank you.

750
00:54:35,667 --> 00:54:37,828
- 班...- 我们不要再说了
-  Benjamin... -  Let's not talk about it.

751
00:54:39,437 --> 00:54:41,234
不要再说了
Let's not talk at all.

752
00:55:17,675 --> 00:55:19,973
伊琳很快就回来了
Elaine's back home soon.

753
00:55:20,378 --> 00:55:23,006
我想应该是你 和她约会的好时机了
I think it might be a nice gesture if you asked her out.

754
00:55:37,295 --> 00:55:39,490
你觉得她不符合你的要求吗？
I suppose she's not good enough for you, is that it?

755
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:42,031
伊琳和我是合不来的
Look, Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.

756
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,330
你怎么知道？ 你们从高中开始就没见面了
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school

757
00:55:44,535 --> 00:55:46,662
你晚上去做的事
I suppose your evenings,

758
00:55:46,738 --> 00:55:49,468
不会比和女孩子 交往更加有价值吧
whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.

759
00:55:49,507 --> 00:55:51,372
这些和那些没有关系
That has nothing to do with it.

760
00:55:51,442 --> 00:55:53,467
我应该告诉罗宾森先生...
I guess I' II just have to tell Mr. Robinson...

761
00:55:53,544 --> 00:55:57,310
你每天晚上都不知道 在做些什么
that you're too busy every evening doing god knows what.

762
00:55:57,348 --> 00:55:59,179
别这样说了
Now don't go on like this.

763
00:55:59,918 --> 00:56:02,944
如果班实在不愿约她出去...
If Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out...

764
00:56:03,021 --> 00:56:04,045
没错
I do.

765
00:56:04,122 --> 00:56:09,185
那我只能约他们 全家到我们家咯
Then I will simply have to invite all the Robinsons over on Thursday.

766
00:56:21,439 --> 00:56:24,431
好了应该四处走走了
Well, Braddock, it's about time you got around to this.

767
00:56:25,476 --> 00:56:27,569
Your wife predicted you would say what?

768
00:56:35,453 --> 00:56:37,045
No points. Right?

769
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:39,452
Here's the next question. Gentlemen...

770
00:56:39,557 --> 00:56:40,649
你好
Hello.

771
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:42,885
What is your wife's most unusual habit?

772
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:44,460
进来吧班
Ben, come on in.

773
00:56:44,495 --> 00:56:48,226
我想那大小姐还没准备好呢
I'm afraid the young lady isn't quite ready yet.

774
00:56:48,866 --> 00:56:51,096
你会怎样回答？
What would you say to a short one?

775
00:56:51,269 --> 00:56:53,794
- 还是喝威士忌吗？ - 波旁酒
-  Scotch still your drink? -  Bourbon.

776
00:56:54,372 --> 00:56:56,169
Can you think of something that bothers you?

777
00:56:59,077 --> 00:57:00,772
Not shaving her legs.

778
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,014
我去看看她
Well, I' II see if she's ready.

779
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:26,195
我不想这样的 是我父亲的想法
Listen, this was not my idea. This was my father's idea.

780
00:57:26,337 --> 00:57:29,431
班我想我已经讲得很清楚的了
Benjamin, I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.

781
00:57:29,507 --> 00:57:32,635
我们就出去坐一下 然后我就把她送回来
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink, and I' II bring her right back.

782
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,702
不然我们两家人 就要一起吃晚餐了
Because it was either that or a dinner party for the 2 families.

783
00:57:35,813 --> 00:57:38,646
我想我应付不了那样
And I' m afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind.

784
00:57:40,251 --> 00:57:43,846
我不会再约你的女儿出去的
Look, I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again,

785
00:57:43,921 --> 00:57:46,253
- 不要那么担心- 我就是...
-  so don't get upset about it. -  I am.

786
00:57:46,858 --> 00:57:49,759
非常担心啊班
I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.

787
00:57:51,462 --> 00:57:52,759
你好
Hello.

788
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:54,630
你好
Hello.

789
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:57,166
希望你们今天晚上玩得开心吧
I want you to keep your wits about you tonight.

790
00:57:57,568 --> 00:58:01,060
你要小心班哦他很狡猾的
You never know what tricks Ben picked up back there in the east.

791
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,575
你现在住在家里吗？
You're living at home now, is that right?

792
00:58:14,685 --> 00:58:15,947
是的
Yes.

793
00:58:16,954 --> 00:58:18,945
你有计划将来做什么吗？
Do you know what you're going to do?

794
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,321
没有
No.

795
00:58:23,461 --> 00:58:25,520
你想读研究生吗？
Are you going to graduate school

796
00:58:26,064 --> 00:58:27,190
不
No.

797
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:35,198
你总是这样驾车的吗？
Do you always drive like this?

798
00:58:35,306 --> 00:58:36,432
是的
Yes.

799
01:00:00,658 --> 01:00:01,955
请坐
Sit down.

800
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:19,109
你为什么不看表演？
Why don't you watch the show?

801
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:25,806
班你是不是讨厌我？
Benjamin, do you dislike me for some reason?

802
01:00:26,083 --> 01:00:28,142
不我怎么会呢？
No. Why should I

803
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,851
我不知道
I don't know.

804
01:00:39,497 --> 01:00:41,795
你错过最精彩的部分了
You're missing a great effect here.

805
01:00:44,835 --> 01:00:46,564
你觉得怎样？
How do you like that?

806
01:00:49,707 --> 01:00:51,436
你可以那样做吗？
Could you do it?

807
01:00:54,712 --> 01:00:56,543
去啊宝贝！
Go, baby, go!

808
01:01:14,565 --> 01:01:16,032
- 停啊！- 喂！
-  Stop! -  Hey!

809
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:26,843
伊琳对不起
Elaine, I' m sorry.

810
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:29,135
伊琳
Elaine.

811
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:32,411
送我回家好吗？
Would you take me home now?

812
01:01:32,483 --> 01:01:33,711
我不该把你带到这里
I'm sorry I took you in there.

813
01:01:33,784 --> 01:01:35,547
我应该回家了
I think I better go home, please.

814
01:01:40,992 --> 01:01:42,357
伊琳
Elaine.

815
01:01:42,393 --> 01:01:43,860
车在哪里？
Where's the car?

816
01:01:43,894 --> 01:01:45,555
我想和你说一些话
I just want to tell you something.

817
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:50,934
我要回家
I want to go home.

818
01:01:50,968 --> 01:01:52,959
就听我说一件事好吗？
But, I just tell you this one thing?

819
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:55,063
什么？
What?

820
01:01:55,172 --> 01:01:57,766
其实... 这次约会只是我父母的主意
This whole idea... this date and everything, it was my parents' idea.

821
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,308
他们逼我这样做的
They forced me into it.

822
01:01:59,477 --> 01:02:01,843
很感谢你告诉我
That's very nice of you to tell me.

823
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,407
不我的意思是 刚才是我刻意做出来的
No, what I mean is, that's why I' ve been acting this way.

824
01:02:04,515 --> 01:02:06,881
我不是那样的人 我讨厌那样做
I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.

825
01:02:11,188 --> 01:02:13,418
请你不要再哭了好吗？
Listen, could you just stop crying, please?

826
01:02:13,524 --> 01:02:15,116
我忍不住
No, I couldn't.

827
01:02:15,192 --> 01:02:16,955
- 你试一下好吗？ - 不行啊
-  Well, could you try? -  No.

828
01:02:31,409 --> 01:02:33,877
自从我毕业以后...
I've had his feeling ever since I' ve graduated...

829
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:36,705
我经常有那种冲动 觉得很烦躁
This kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time,

830
01:02:36,814 --> 01:02:38,111
你明白我的意思吗？
You know what I mean?

831
01:02:40,718 --> 01:02:42,242
明白
Yes, I do.

832
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,120
我觉得就像在玩一种游戏
It's like I was playing some kind of game,

833
01:02:45,156 --> 01:02:47,181
但规则对我来说毫无意义
but the rules don't make any sense to me.

834
01:02:47,525 --> 01:02:49,720
都是某些人错误地制造出来的
They're being made up by all the wrong people.

835
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,222
不
No.

836
01:02:51,629 --> 01:02:54,792
我觉得不是他们去玩游戏 而是他们被游戏玩弄
I mean, no one makes them up. They seem to make themselves up.

837
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,029
喂！
Say!

838
01:02:58,135 --> 01:03:00,831
能把音量调小一点吗？
Could I request that you turn that down?

839
01:03:52,189 --> 01:03:53,781
你想进屋里吗？
Would you like to come in?

840
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:56,384
我请你喝杯咖啡
I could make you some coffee.

841
01:03:57,928 --> 01:03:59,896
不了我不想打扰其他人
No. I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.

842
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:02,197
不会的
We won't.

843
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,890
我们进去吧
Let's go inside.

844
01:04:04,301 --> 01:04:05,700
等等
Wait a minute.

845
01:04:05,736 --> 01:04:07,294
怎么了？
Is anything wrong?

846
01:04:09,106 --> 01:04:10,539
没什么我在想...
No. I was just thinking.

847
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:12,732
现在还早着呢
It's still early.

848
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:15,305
我们还可以去别的地方玩
Maybe we could do something, go somewhere else.

849
01:04:17,214 --> 01:04:18,579
好啊
All right.

850
01:04:25,823 --> 01:04:27,347
我们去哪里？
Where are we going?

851
01:04:27,725 --> 01:04:30,489
我在想附近有什么地方 可以喝酒的
I'm trying to think of... where there's a place to have a drink around here.

852
01:04:30,561 --> 01:04:32,654
不是有一间泰福酒店吗？
Isn't there one at the taft hotel

853
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:36,065
怎么了？
What is the matter?

854
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:39,193
没什么 我不知道那里有没有酒吧
Nothing. I' m just wondering if they have a bar or not.

855
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,099
我们去看看吧
I mean, let's go see.

856
01:04:41,172 --> 01:04:42,696
看看那里有没有
Let's go see if they do or not.

857
01:04:44,775 --> 01:04:47,266
伊琳据我所知
Listen, Elaine, it seems to me that there isn't a bar here.

858
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:48,504
这里似乎没有酒吧哦
I mean, as far as I know.

859
01:04:48,579 --> 01:04:50,809
当然有了就在那里
Of course there is. Look, there's the palm room right there.

860
01:04:51,148 --> 01:04:52,240
晚安
Good evening.

861
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,108
- 你好- 你好先生

格莱斯登先生晚上好啊
Hi, Mr. Gladstone. How are you this evening?

865
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:05,086

我们走吧伊琳 去其他地方
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.

867

- 他们认识你吗？ - 当然不认识了
-  Do they know you? -  Of course not.

868
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,667
- 晚上好先生 - 伊琳我们走吧
-  Good evening, sir. -  Come on, Elaine, we're leaving.

869

格莱斯登先生你好吗？
Mr. Gladstone, how are you?

870
01:05:16,874 --> 01:05:18,776
- 班到底怎么了？ - 我不知道
-  Benjamin, what's happening? -  I don't know.

871
01:05:18,776 --> 01:05:20,903
他们把我当成 是什么格莱斯登先生了
They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.

872
01:05:20,978 --> 01:05:22,707
你好布迪夫先生
Hello, Mr. Braniff.

873
01:05:35,392 --> 01:05:38,828
伊琳我很喜欢你
Elaine, I like you. Ilike you so much.

874
01:05:39,997 --> 01:05:41,828
你相信我吗？
Do you believe that?

875
01:05:45,336 --> 01:05:47,702
- 是吗？- 是的
-  Do you? -  Yes.

876
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:50,970
你是第一个...
You're the first...

877
01:05:52,743 --> 01:05:55,803
我觉得你是第一个...
You're the first thing for so long that I' ve liked,

878
01:05:56,614 --> 01:05:58,844
我想一起生活的人
the first person I could stand to be with.

879
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:04,420
我的一生就那么浪费了
My whole life is such a waste.

880
01:06:05,456 --> 01:06:07,083
徒劳无功
It's just nothing.

881
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:14,457
不好意思我现在送你回家
I'm sorry. I'll take you home now.

882
01:06:18,135 --> 01:06:20,535
班你是不是因为 某个人而烦恼？
Benjamin, are you having an affair with someone?

883
01:06:26,877 --> 01:06:28,367
对不起
I'm sorry.

884
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:30,704
对不起那是你的私事
I'm sorry. That's not my business.

885
01:06:31,549 --> 01:06:33,312
已经发生了
It just happened.

886
01:06:35,452 --> 01:06:39,081
就像其他事情那样发生了
It's just this thing that happened along with everything else.

887
01:06:40,257 --> 01:06:42,122
你明白吗？
Can you understand that?

888
01:06:43,661 --> 01:06:45,492
她结了婚？
Was she married or something?

889
01:06:47,064 --> 01:06:48,622
是的
Yes.

890
01:06:49,266 --> 01:06:50,927

是的有丈夫和孩子

892
01:06:55,272 --> 01:06:57,866
- 他们发现了吗？- 没有
-  Did they ever find out? -  No.

893
01:07:01,378 --> 01:07:03,437
说完了吗？
And it's all over now?

894
01:07:05,883 --> 01:07:07,441
是的
Yes.

895
01:07:13,891 --> 01:07:15,620
我很开心

- 你是学生？- 不算是

It's all right, Mr. Mccleery.

1040
01:22:42,619 --> 01:22:45,144
尖叫就肯定有事
Screaming is not all right, not in my house, It isn't.

1041
01:22:45,321 --> 01:22:47,721
只是我的一个客人 现在没事了
It was just a visitor, but it's all right now.

1042
01:22:49,826 --> 01:22:51,191
你对她做了些什么？
What did you do to her?

1043
01:22:51,427 --> 01:22:54,521
她只是很压抑所以叫了一声 现在好了
Look, she's all right. She's upset, and she screamed, but it's ok now.

1044
01:22:54,631 --> 01:22:56,121
- 要叫警察来吗？- 什么？
-  Shall I get the cops? -  What?

1045
01:22:56,232 --> 01:22:57,961
- 我去报警- 喂等一等
-  I' II get the cops. -  Hey, wait a minute.

1046
01:22:58,368 --> 01:22:59,596
可恶听我说
Now, damn it, look.

1047
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:02,131
她就在这里喝着水
Here she is, having some water.

1048
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,531
没必要叫警察来
There's no need for the cops or anything.

1049
01:23:05,742 --> 01:23:08,540
好了大家回去吧
All right, boys, you can all go back to your rooms now.

1050
01:23:09,045 --> 01:23:10,273
去吧
Go ahead.

1051
01:23:10,847 --> 01:23:12,940
我不想再发生这种事
We won't have any more of this agitation.

1052
01:23:14,851 --> 01:23:16,785
- 明白了吗布先生？- 好的
-  Will we, Braddock? -  No, sir.

1053
01:23:19,989 --> 01:23:21,547
我要你搬走
I want you out of here.

1054
01:23:22,258 --> 01:23:24,351
- 什么意思？- 我要你搬走
-  What do you mean? -  You heard me out of here.

1055
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,690
- 为什么？- 因为我不喜欢你
-  What for? -  Because I don't like you.

1056
01:23:59,696 --> 01:24:01,357
刚才的事很抱歉
I'm sorry I screamed.

1057
01:24:05,802 --> 01:24:08,100
班你来这里之前
Benjamin, when you came up here,

1058
01:24:08,204 --> 01:24:10,331
有想过我们之间 会发生什么事吗？
what did you think was going to happen between us?

1059
01:24:12,308 --> 01:24:14,776
伊琳我现在不想说什么
Elaine, right now I don't feel like talking much.

1060
01:24:14,844 --> 01:24:17,972
我为我所做的一切道歉 现在我只能离开这里了
I'm sorry about everything, but I think I' II just do this now.

1061
01:24:29,859 --> 01:24:31,986
我可以在这看你收拾行李吗？
Can I just sit here while you're packing?

1062
01:24:47,477 --> 01:24:49,104
你有什么打算？
What are you going to do now?

1063
01:24:50,346 --> 01:24:51,836
我不知道
I don't know.

1064
01:24:52,548 --> 01:24:54,880
- 你会回家吗？- 不
-  Are you going home? -  No.

1065
01:24:55,084 --> 01:24:56,915
那你要去哪里？
Well, where are you going?

1066
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:03,051
伊琳请你不要再问了
Elaine, you're going to have to stop asking me that.

1067
01:25:16,272 --> 01:25:18,103
我不想你马上就走
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

1068
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:22,768
我不明白
I don't understand.

1069
01:25:23,179 --> 01:25:24,840
在你有明确的方向之前...
I don't want you to go anywhere...

1070
01:25:28,084 --> 01:25:29,847
我不想你离开这里
Until you have a definite plan.

1071
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,315
再见
Good- bye.

1072
01:26:08,057 --> 01:26:09,649
怎么了？
What's happening?

1073
01:26:09,859 --> 01:26:11,554
- 班？- 什么？
-  Benjamin? -  What?

1074
01:26:17,533 --> 01:26:19,023
亲我一下好吗？
Will you kiss me?

1075
01:26:46,763 --> 01:26:48,355
你愿意嫁给我吗？
Will you marry me?

1076
01:26:51,868 --> 01:26:54,359
- 你不想？- 我不知道
-  You won't? -  I don't know.

1077
01:26:57,373 --> 01:26:59,034
有可能吗？
But you might?

1078
01:27:00,176 --> 01:27:01,700
有的
I might.

1079
01:27:02,011 --> 01:27:03,569
是吗？
Is that so?

1080
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:06,614
- 你可能会嫁给我？- 是的
-  You might marry me? -  Yes.

1081
01:27:07,784 --> 01:27:09,274
什么时候？
When?

1082
01:27:10,419 --> 01:27:12,046
我不知道
I don't know.

1083
01:27:12,321 --> 01:27:14,721
明天回答我好吗？ 我不想逼你太紧
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy.

1084
01:27:14,824 --> 01:27:16,553
我不知道
I don't know.

1085
01:27:17,627 --> 01:27:19,686
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what's happening.

1086
01:27:21,697 --> 01:27:23,392
你很迷惑吗？
You mean you're confused?

1087
01:27:26,102 --> 01:27:27,763
不要这样
Look, don't be confused.

1088
01:27:28,604 --> 01:27:30,128
我们就要结婚了
We're getting married.

1089
01:27:31,908 --> 01:27:33,432
我不知道怎么可以
I don't see how we can.

1090
01:27:37,013 --> 01:27:38,605
一定可以的
We just can.

1091
01:27:46,122 --> 01:27:47,612
我要走了
I have to go now.

1092
01:27:49,025 --> 01:27:50,356
伊琳？
Hey, Elaine?

1093
01:27:52,061 --> 01:27:53,756
你是认真的吗？
Are you serious about this?

1094
01:27:55,131 --> 01:27:56,530
我会考虑清楚的
I'll think about it.

1095
01:27:56,966 --> 01:27:59,025
- 真的吗？- 是的
-  You really will? -  Yes.

1096
01:28:12,181 --> 01:28:13,671
太好了
Good god.

1097
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:17,846
我们明天可以去体检了
We can go get our blood tests tomorrow.

1098
01:28:17,887 --> 01:28:19,411
- 明天？- 今天下午也行
-  Tomorrow? -  Or this afternoon.

1099
01:28:19,455 --> 01:28:20,649
今天很好啊
It's a good day for it.

1100
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:23,159
班我还没决定要嫁给你呢
Benjamin, I haven't even said I' II marry you yet.

1101
01:28:23,159 --> 01:28:24,558
要我们的出生证明的
We'll need our birth certificates.

1102
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:27,458
我刚好带在身上你的呢？
I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?

1103
01:28:27,864 --> 01:28:30,128
- 我觉得不太可行- 为什么？
-  I just don't think it would work. -  Why wouldn't it?

1104
01:28:42,178 --> 01:28:45,113
- 为什么？- 我就觉得不会
-  Why wouldn't it? -  I just don't think it would.

1105
01:28:46,582 --> 01:28:49,745
那我们明天再去体检好吗？
Tomorrow, then. Can we get our blood tests tomorrow morning?

1106
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:53,983
如果你那么想和我结婚 为什么不直接把我掳走呢？
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?

1107
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:55,990
为什么不直接把你掳走？
Why don't I just drag you off?

1108
01:28:56,092 --> 01:28:59,255
好体检之后我会做的
All right. I will, right after we get the blood tests.

1109
01:28:59,629 --> 01:29:01,494
我要先见卡尔
I have to see Carl first.

1110
01:29:01,597 --> 01:29:03,326
卡尔是谁？
Carl who?

1111
01:29:06,502 --> 01:29:08,299
卡尔是谁？
Carl who?

1112
01:29:08,704 --> 01:29:11,867
卡尔.史密斯读医学的 我们认识很久了
Carl smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.

1113
01:29:12,008 --> 01:29:14,033
- 在动物园的那个？- 是的
-  Who, that guy at the zoo? -  Yes.

1114
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:17,102
- 为什么你要见他？ - 我说过可能会和他结婚的
-  Why do you have to see him? -  Well, I said I might marry him.

1115
01:29:19,048 --> 01:29:20,572
什么？！
You what?!

1116
01:29:20,917 --> 01:29:22,578
他是怎么做的？
How did he do it?

1117
01:29:22,718 --> 01:29:24,310
有跪在地上吗？
Did he get down on his knees?

1118
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,320
我想他没有那样吧
He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.

1119
01:29:26,355 --> 01:29:27,913
没有
No, Benjamin.

1120
01:29:28,024 --> 01:29:30,117
他说了什么？我很好奇
What did he say? I'm curious.

1121
01:29:30,226 --> 01:29:31,625
嘘
Shh.

1122
01:29:31,727 --> 01:29:35,026
他说我和他会组织一个 好家庭的
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.

1123
01:29:35,231 --> 01:29:38,325
- 噢他这样说了？- 嘘！
-  Oh, no. He said that? -  Shh!

1124
01:29:38,434 --> 01:29:39,992
他在哪里说的？
Where did he do it?

1125
01:29:41,671 --> 01:29:43,866
我想知道在哪里
I'd like to know where it happened.

1126
01:29:46,742 --> 01:29:48,767
不会在他的车上吧？
It wasn't in his car, was it?

1127
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:03,557
晚安
Good night.

1128
01:30:03,693 --> 01:30:06,059
我们明天可以结婚吗？
Are we getting married tomorrow?

1129
01:30:06,696 --> 01:30:08,061
不
No.

1130
01:30:09,165 --> 01:30:10,723
后天呢？
The day after tomorrow?

1131
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:15,834
不知道也许可以 也许不可以
I don't know. Maybe we are, and maybe we're not.

1132
01:31:06,322 --> 01:31:09,655
你想解释一下 为什么你要那样做吗？
Do you want to, uh... do you want to try and tell me why you did it?

1133
01:31:11,527 --> 01:31:12,926
罗宾森先生
Mr. Robinson.

1134
01:31:13,129 --> 01:31:14,960
你有什么特别憎恨我的吗？
Do you have a special grudge against me?

1135
01:31:15,064 --> 01:31:17,362
你有什么想报复我的吗？
Do you feel a particularly strong resentment?

1136
01:31:17,433 --> 01:31:18,525
没有
No.

1137
01:31:18,634 --> 01:31:20,761
是不是因为我说过的某些话
Is there something I' ve said that's caused this contempt,

1138
01:31:20,836 --> 01:31:23,600
或者是你鄙视我什么吗？
or is it just things I stand for that you despise?

1139
01:31:23,739 --> 01:31:25,366
和你没有关系的先生
It was nothing to do with you, sir.

1140
01:31:25,474 --> 01:31:28,466
班那和我绝对是有关系的
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.

1141
01:31:28,544 --> 01:31:30,034
请你...
Now, look, please...

1142
01:31:30,146 --> 01:31:31,841
班我们都是受过教育的人
Ben, I think we're 2 civilized human beings.

1143
01:31:31,947 --> 01:31:33,778
有必要这样互相威胁吗？
Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?

1144
01:31:33,849 --> 01:31:35,339
我不是在威胁你
I'm not threatening you.

1145
01:31:35,451 --> 01:31:38,147
你想动手吗？那好啊
Do you want to unclench your fist, please? Thank you.

1146
01:31:38,354 --> 01:31:40,879
我在暗处看你看得很清楚的
I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.

1147
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:44,751
我想说我对你没有任何的成见
I'm trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson.

1148
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:46,794
我不是想报复你
I'm trying to tell you I do not resent you.

1149
01:31:46,862 --> 01:31:49,387
你一点也不尊重我
You don't respect me terribly much, either.

1150
01:31:50,299 --> 01:31:51,857
- 不是的- 什么？
-  No, sir. -  What?

1151
01:31:52,068 --> 01:31:54,662
- 不是 - 不要对我大喊班
-  No, sir. -  Don't shout at me, Ben.

1152
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:57,432
我没你那么年轻 但我的听觉还是很好的
I may not be as young as you, but I still have pretty good hearing.

1153
01:31:57,473 --> 01:32:00,806
- 罗宾森先生... - 先等我说完
-  Mr. Robinson... -  Have the decency to wait until I finish.

1154
01:32:02,078 --> 01:32:04,638
我想你很清楚后果 会是怎样的
I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done.

1155
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:08,181
我想你知道我和我妻子 很快就要离婚的
I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

1156
01:32:08,584 --> 01:32:10,051
为什么？
But why?

1157
01:32:10,086 --> 01:32:11,519
为什么？！
Why?!

1158
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,144
听我说
Listen to me.

1159
01:32:13,923 --> 01:32:16,949
罗宾森太太和我之间的事...
What happened between Mrs. Robinson and me was nothing.

1160
01:32:17,126 --> 01:32:18,718
并不代表什么
It didn't mean anything.

1161
01:32:18,828 --> 01:32:22,320
我们就像是在握手
We might just as well have been shaking hands.

1162
01:32:22,498 --> 01:32:24,056
在握手
Shaking hands.

1163
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,464
不是这样说我老婆吧？
That's not saying much for my wife, is it?

1164
01:32:26,502 --> 01:32:28,732
- 你误解了- 我想是了
-  You miss the point. -  I guess I do.

1165
01:32:28,804 --> 01:32:31,637
我喜欢的是你女儿 不是你太太
The point is, I don't love your wife. Ilove your daughter, sir.

1166
01:32:32,641 --> 01:32:34,609
好了听我说
All right. Now listen to this.

1167
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:37,711
我不知道是否可以起诉 但我想是可以的
I don't know whether I can prosecute, but I think I can.

1168
01:32:37,847 --> 01:32:41,613
如果你再烦我女儿 我可以令你坐牢的
I think I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again.

1169
01:32:42,051 --> 01:32:45,020
我见过伊琳了 我可以肯定你不会得到她
I've seen Elaine, and I' ve made damn sure you can't get to her.

1170
01:32:45,121 --> 01:32:46,588
别碰我班！
Stay away from me, Ben!

1171
01:32:47,823 --> 01:32:49,586
我不想和你浪费时间
I don't want to mince words with you.

1172
01:32:49,658 --> 01:32:53,924
要想见到伊琳 她现在已经在50里外的地方了
As far as Elaine is concerned, you're to get her out of your filthy mind right now.

1173
01:32:54,029 --> 01:32:56,463
你听清楚了吗？
Is that perfectly clear to you?

1174
01:32:56,632 --> 01:33:01,035
我说完了班 别怪我不和你握手
And that's all, Ben. You'll pardon me if I don't shake hands with you.

1175
01:33:03,038 --> 01:33:05,063
我觉得你很无耻
I think you are filth.

1176
01:33:05,274 --> 01:33:07,572
你很下流！
I think you are scum!

1177
01:33:09,245 --> 01:33:10,940
你是个废物！
You are a degenerate!

1178
01:33:16,952 --> 01:33:18,214
你好
Hi.

1179
01:33:20,556 --> 01:33:23,548
房东你有硬币吗？ 我要打个电话
Mr. Mccleery, do you have some change? I need to use the phone.

1180
01:33:23,859 --> 01:33:25,759
我要你马上离开这里
I want you out of here.

1181
01:33:25,961 --> 01:33:29,362
我用10块和你换一个硬币 20也行
Look, I' II give you $10 for a dime. I'll give you 20.

1182
01:33:30,166 --> 01:33:32,498
求你给我打个电话好吗？
For god's sake, will you let me use that phone?

1183
