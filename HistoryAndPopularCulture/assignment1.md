The 1960s is one of the most turbulent eras in American history. It was not the time that the US has just won in WW2, in which the US people trust their institution and norms, believing they were the lighthouse of the world. It was the time that the baby boomers become adults. It was the time that the cloud of war covered the land: the Cold War was at the peak, Cuban Missile Crisis nearly drawn the whole world to abyss together, the US was stuck in Vietnam War. It was the time that thoughts were colliding: Egalitarianism, Feminism, Communism...... The movies at that time can be seen both as a reflection to the society, or as an activate catalyst in social movements.

The three movies both showed the challenge of 1960s American institutions, but in different degrees. From simply challenging social norms and calling on people to live the life they want, to questioning the improperly in government and taking active activation in reforming the society, to directly point out how absurd the old institution was, these movies form a panorama of 1960s' American society.

## Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid: Get rid of the old Norms. 

Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid tells a story out of classic track. The characters of Butch, Sundance and Etta, represent a rebel to old American institutions. Traditional cowboy rules were not shown in this movie, which suggests that the Americans were less constrained by begone moral norm. Especially, the character of Etta also shows influence of feminism moves in 1960s. 

## Bullitt: Distrust government but contribute to the nation in different ways. 

In Bullitt, the main character, Bullitt, is dissimilar with traditional police. Bullitt is determined to find out the truth of that case, and he is willing to break some rules proved that necessary. This illustrates that different from the period of World War 2 and the following decade after the war, Americans begin to question their institutions, and begin to take activities on their own standpoints. We may see Bullitt's bold activities were just like the many social movements in 1960s: people stood out to fight against what they thought is improper: the Vietnam War, the WASP-centered society, and racial discrimination long rooted in America.  

## Planet of the Apes: A fierce criticism for institutions and a call for fairer society.

If we can still say that the first two films did not mean to call on its audience to question about the society though them reflects the in trend thought of American society, the third film, Planet of the Apes, was not only a reflection but also a strong appealing on the audience to question about the long lasted American norm and the society. Planet of the Apes used  different imagery to build up a wierd but thought-provoking society, the so-called "reversed world". When a traditional WASP was suddenly placed at the bottom of the society, subsequently he realized how unfair the society was and how weak an inferior individual was in that society. Besides the reversing of man kind and the apes, the social stratum in Apes' society, the ape society's resistance to change and the relationship between the male astronaut and Nova, as well as Zira, also mirrors the American society. By doing this, this film pointed out how absurd the American society is now, and criticized the American institutions. Also, these movies elaborated ideas about Environmentalism and Pacifism.

Though this movie seemed to be aggressive on criticizing American institutions, it is still a phenomenal success. On one hand, this movie is good enough, not only in criticizing the society, but also in other aspects. On the other hand, the popularity of this movie also reflects that the American people are realizing the problems in the society. 


## Summary

To sum up, both the three movies demonstrate 1960s Americans' changing attitudes toward American institutions. In Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, we can see that the Americans were getting rid of their old traditions and seeking for new lifestyles. In Bullitt, we can see that the Americans were questioning about their government, while at the same time they were also being influenced by the idea of contributing the society themselves. Falling in the swamp of Vietnam War, people started to question if the government was doing this for the good of America, or just for the interests of the politicians. As suggested in this movie, people stood out for parade against the war, thinking they were doing the right thing for the country. The third movie is a fierce criticism for institutions, it deconstructs traditional WASP-centered Norm by putting a typical WASP character in a reversed society. The once dominators became "animals", and had to observe the society in a different view. It showed that some American had noticed the racial problems and the social stratification problems. The popularity of this movie also illustrated that these ideas can be widely accepted.

<!-- A conclusion about the Americans' changing attitudes toward American institutions -->

Then we can make a picture about the American society in 1960s in accordance with the three movies: It was the age of rebel, people were not satisfied with the past norm of the society and they decided to do something different, such as the hippies movement. It was the age of citizen participation, people get out of their home to question their government and make a sound for their political ideas. It was the age of war and peace, the world was still in the swirl called "the Cold War" and the US was mired in Vietnam. Many Americans protested because they thought the war in Vietnam was worthless. It was the age of calling for social fair, females challenged their full-time homemaker roles and asking to find fair position in male-dominated society, civil right protesters protest against the long taken for granted racial discrimination and social classes. It was the time that old institutions were challenged and reformed.
