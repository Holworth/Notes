1
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,134
- This is Pete.
- Yeah?

2
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:20,699
We lost him.

3
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,499
He's your brother, Ross. If you can't
find him, we have people who will.

4
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:29,072
And you're paying for the contract.

5
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:47,318
Excuse me. Have you got
a message for Mr. Ross?

6
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:48,359
What room, sir?

7
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:50,519
I'm not a guest.

8
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:51,961
- I'll check.
- Thanks.

9
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,305
- That's, Johnny Ross.
- Yes, sir.

10
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,011
Sorry, sir, nothing.

11
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:08,410
Nothing?

12
00:05:09,081 --> 00:05:10,173
Are you sure?

13
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:11,580
I'm sure, sir.

14
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:15,715
Okay, thanks.

15
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:38,635
Thank you.

16
00:05:56,762 --> 00:05:58,525
Yes, I'm sure it was him.

17
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,731
Sunshine Cab, 6912.

18
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:11,808
Would you pull up?
I want to make a call.

19
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:12,775
Right.

20
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:14,501
Yeah?

21
00:07:15,107 --> 00:07:15,971
Delgetti.

22
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,739
What is it?

23
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,177
Work.

24
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:23,377
Frank, let me in, will you?

25
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:56,744
What time did you get to bed
this morning, Frank?

26
00:07:57,849 --> 00:07:59,009
About 5:00.

27
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:17,530
"Mumps vaccine on the market.

28
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:19,229
"The government authorized yesterday...

29
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:23,673
"...what officials term the first clearly
effective vaccine to prevent mumps...

30
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:30,110
"...announced it has granted
a license for the vaccine... .

31
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,649
"...at 12:45 Wednesday--"

32
00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:41,750
Why don't you just relax and have
your orange juice, and shut up, Delgetti?

33
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:47,455
Let's go, Frank.

34
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:51,992
Lt. Bullitt to see you, Mr. Chalmers.

35
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:58,063
It was purely unintentional, I assure you.

36
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:01,970
It wasn't that I was so well-informed,
it was just that he was so ill-informed.

37
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,338
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?

38
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:17,345
In Orinda, we have all this beautiful
dry sunshine. Absolutely perfect for roses.

39
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:20,357
I do all my own work.
See my hands? They prove it.

40
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,526
Hello. Lieutenant, how are you?

41
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:27,825
Thanks for coming over.
Name is Frank, isn't it?

42
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,197
- That's right.
- Please call me Walter.

43
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:35,940
I have an important job for you.

44
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:38,373
Captain Bennet suggested
that you take it.

45
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:41,969
As you know, there is a Senate
subcommittee hearing here Monday.

46
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:44,815
I have a star witness
who needs protection.

47
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:47,481
Sam said that you were
the man for the job.

48
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:50,617
And I can't find a flaw in that statement.

49
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:52,354
Protection from who?

50
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,251
The Organization.

51
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:59,227
His name is Ross.
Johnny Ross. From Chicago.

52
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:03,728
Once and for all, the top men
in law enforcement are united.

53
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:06,701
We're going to expose the Organization.

54
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:08,328
I read your speech.

55
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:10,168
Why San Francisco?

56
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:13,538
Ross is safer here. That's your province.

57
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,006
Keeping him out of reach for 40 hours.

58
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:17,747
Where?

59
00:11:18,216 --> 00:11:19,706
The Hotel Daniels.

60
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:22,753
226 Embarcadero Road. Room 634.

61
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:25,249
He's there now, expecting you.

62
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:29,583
Now that you know where my house is...

63
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,687
...I hope that we'll get to see
a lot more of each other.

64
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:34,925
Particularly in view of the investigation.

65
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,401
A senatorial hearing has a way of...

66
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:40,700
...catapulting everyone involved
into the public eye...

67
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,330
...with subsequent effect on one's career.

68
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:47,177
It will be a pleasure to have you along.

69
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,874
Have him in court on Monday, Frank.

70
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:07,731
What was that all about?

71
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,458
Pals.

72
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,091
You and Chalmers, huh?
There's a lot of juice?

73
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,868
Hotel Daniels, 226 Embarcadero Road.

74
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:15,736
State's evidence witness,
and we're baby-sitting.

75
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:16,831
Let's go.

76
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:10,291
- Yeah, who is it?
- Police.

77
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:11,852
The roof and the exits.

78
00:13:22,874 --> 00:13:24,899
Mr. Chalmers said you'd be here by 5:00.

79
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,102
He guaranteed me that.

80
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:28,475
Oh, sorry, we got held up in traffic.

81
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:30,808
Got any firearms?

82
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,551
No, man, I've got nothing on me.
Just my wallet...

83
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:36,452
...cigarette lighter.

84
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:38,447
Want to check me out yourself?

85
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:42,482
No, that's not necessary. Put that stuff
on the bed, will you, please?

86
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:48,495
How did you...
how did you get here from Chicago?

87
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:50,126
I flew.

88
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:54,967
Sure none of the boys were on the plane
with you, or saw you get on?

89
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,837
How would I know? I wouldn't know.

90
00:13:57,242 --> 00:13:59,005
How come you picked this room
to hole up?

91
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:01,238
I didn't pick it. Chalmers picked it.

92
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:02,580
Why?

93
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:05,712
Stay away from those windows!
That's why.

94
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:14,489
Sit down and relax, Ross.
It's a long wait until Monday morning.

95
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:16,917
We'd better get a fix on some food.

96
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:19,020
- What?
- Some food.

97
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:23,723
I know Chalmers wants you to be happy,
and we'll do the best we can.

98
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:24,860
Dad, it's for you.

99
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:28,770
Listen, you're not going. You're not going.
We're going to a movie.

100
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:34,339
Hold it down. Hold it down.
Now, don't be too late.

101
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:37,009
- Hello.
- Hello. Captain?

102
00:14:37,248 --> 00:14:37,907
Frank?

103
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:39,643
We'll see you later, Dad.

104
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:41,215
I've seen Chalmers.

105
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,348
What do you know about Ross?

106
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:45,082
Chicago. It could be very big.

107
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,386
He had access to all the records. He ran
the wire services with his brother, Pete.

108
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:50,951
Did Chalmers ask for me?

109
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:55,060
Do you happen to know why?

110
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:58,296
Yes, I know why.
He's grooming himself for public office.

111
00:14:58,903 --> 00:15:01,895
You make good copy.
They love you in the papers, Frank.

112
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:03,265
I see.

113
00:15:03,908 --> 00:15:06,172
Okay. So long, Sam.

114
00:15:07,312 --> 00:15:10,509
Say, who were you talking to about me
on that telephone?

115
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,777
Mr. Chalmers said
this was just between me and him.

116
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,513
Me and him, and that's all.

117
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,982
Delgetti will take the first shift.
Stanton will be on at 12:00.

118
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:21,025
I'll take the third.

119
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:23,686
All you've got to worry about
is staying away from those windows.

120
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:24,956
Especially at night.

121
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,629
You call me before you leave.

122
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:27,858
Excuse me.

123
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:42,042
Fire escape and the freeway.

124
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:43,941
The bad news, right?

125
00:15:44,015 --> 00:15:45,573
Right. Want me to stay?

126
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,447
No. Go on home to your wife.

127
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,611
What shift?

128
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:49,447
Second.

129
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:52,251
If we work on the weekend,
we get two days off?

130
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:54,658
So long.

131
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,529
- Hi.
- Hi.

132
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,439
Is this the new fountain?

133
00:16:20,518 --> 00:16:23,544
Fountain? All the client can afford
is a leaky faucet!

134
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:27,787
I thought that,
money didn't matter to artists.

135
00:16:28,593 --> 00:16:30,288
It costs money to have a soul.

136
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:35,357
"Friction loss of water in feet
per hundred feet. Length of pipe... .

137
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:39,335
"Formula using constant one-hundred size
of standard pipe in inches."

138
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:41,669
I want to use
600 gallons of water per minute.

139
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:44,799
Now what's the velocity per second
of a five-inch pipe?

140
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:52,282
Look to the extreme right.

141
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:55,481
Now go down the figures
until you find 600.

142
00:16:58,523 --> 00:16:59,285
Got it.

143
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:02,520
Now go across until you find
the five-inch pipe column.

144
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:04,353
What does it say?

145
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:05,726
Nine point eight.

146
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:07,864
Now I want the loss in feet.

147
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:11,995
Feet, huh?

148
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:15,437
Well?

149
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:18,442
I lost my place. Nobody's perfect.

150
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:27,216
May I use your phone, please?

151
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:29,219
Good evening. Right this way.

152
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:34,554
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

153
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,625
Coffee Cantata. 931-0770.

154
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,736
- 931-0770.
- Right.

155
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:50,838
If a Sergeant Delgetti calls me...

156
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:54,003
...would you be kind enough
to let me know right away?

157
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,725
Del. I'm coming off now.

158
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:52,055
Everything okay?

159
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,358
Yeah, sure.

160
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:56,831
Hey, hold it down, will you?

161
00:19:57,502 --> 00:19:58,696
I'm sorry.

162
00:20:06,344 --> 00:20:07,777
Anything for Stanton?

163
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:09,403
No, I'll see you tomorrow.

164
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,727
Who was it?

165
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:28,962
Del.

166
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,428
Something exciting?

167
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,006
Go to sleep.

168
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,737
Meaning you won't tell me anything.

169
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,240
It's not for you, baby.

170
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:48,715
Anything you do is part of me.

171
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,406
Front desk. Two gentlemen.
Shall I send them up?

172
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,636
What are their names?

173
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:48,337
Hold on a minute.

174
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:52,978
Mr. Chalmers and a friend.

175
00:21:57,088 --> 00:22:00,489
Listen, tell them to wait.
And give me 421-7596.

176
00:22:12,637 --> 00:22:14,036
- Frank?
- Yeah.

177
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:17,431
Chalmers is downstairs and another man.
They want to come up.

178
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,272
Chalmers, at one o'clock in the morning?

179
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:23,245
No, don't let them in.
I'll be there in five minutes.

180
00:22:24,015 --> 00:22:25,915
Please, away from the door.

181
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,244
Here are the latest baseball scores,
just in.

182
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:30,446
In the National League,
San Francisco Giants...

183
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:32,785
...beat the Dodgers in both ends
of a double-header.

184
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:36,691
A 2-0 shutout in the twinighter
and 4-1 win in the nightcap.

185
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:53,207
No, wait... .

186
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:55,310
Now look.

187
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:59,446
They told me... .

188
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:14,418
Who is it?

189
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:16,926
Ross. Two guys.
They got him with a shotgun.

190
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:17,892
What about Stanton?

191
00:24:17,962 --> 00:24:19,657
They got him in the leg.
They're bringing him down.

192
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,890
Stick with Ross.

193
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:24,796
Soon as the lab men get out
of 634, seal it.

194
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:27,167
- But seal it, Barney.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:28,161
How bad?

196
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:29,665
Bad. He's got a bleeder.

197
00:25:46,117 --> 00:25:47,175
Door is not open.

198
00:25:47,985 --> 00:25:49,316
Somebody screwed up.

199
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:50,715
They screwed up. The door's not open.

200
00:25:50,788 --> 00:25:52,380
Somebody put the bed in.

201
00:26:19,617 --> 00:26:21,050
I know you're hurting.

202
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:23,377
But I've got to know, now.

203
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:26,615
The two men.
Do you remember anything?

204
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:30,394
Caucasian.

205
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:35,062
The one who fired, about 5 foot 10.
White hair.

206
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,224
Gun, Winchester pump.

207
00:26:40,137 --> 00:26:42,571
All I remember. Came in so fast.

208
00:26:46,911 --> 00:26:49,402
Chain was off. He unlocked the door.

209
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,074
Who unlocked it?

210
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:53,742
Ross. Like he was expecting someone.

211
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,082
How is my leg?

212
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:01,258
Hold on, Carl, we'll be there
in a couple of minutes.

213
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:32,550
Get out of the way.

214
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:36,715
To the right.

215
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:47,002
Let's go.

216
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:51,740
Scissors, Joe.

217
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:55,509
Somebody get the blood pressure.

218
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:57,572
Oxygen.

219
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:02,146
Can I have an APD pad?

220
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:08,219
Can you move your hand?

221
00:28:08,325 --> 00:28:12,625
Say, do you want to step out? Your buddy
is all right. His leg should be okay.

222
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:14,359
Somebody get X-ray.

223
00:28:17,835 --> 00:28:18,995
How's Stanton?

224
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:21,833
He'll be all right,
but he's busted up. Ross?

225
00:28:22,406 --> 00:28:23,839
I don't know, Frank.

226
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:28,235
You better call Stanton's wife
and get her over here.

227
00:28:28,345 --> 00:28:29,539
Okay.

228
00:28:39,356 --> 00:28:40,050
Here you go.

229
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:42,024
What is it?

230
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:44,591
What's his blood pressure now?

231
00:28:44,662 --> 00:28:45,651
Scissors.

232
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:49,395
It's down to 90 over 70.

233
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:55,396
Suture.

234
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,599
Scissors.

235
00:29:00,978 --> 00:29:03,071
- Better let me tie this one.
- Okay.

236
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,247
Get some balm, please.

237
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:15,622
He's dropping.
Pulse is also going up, now.

238
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:19,490
What was it pre-op?

239
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:21,856
BP pre-op was 34 over 90.

240
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,297
Kahn, take this.

241
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:24,698
Now it's down to 90 over 70.

242
00:29:24,768 --> 00:29:25,860
How much blood do you have?

243
00:29:26,003 --> 00:29:29,097
We have four up here,
and we've ordered four more units.

244
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:31,872
How much have you given him?

245
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:36,302
- We're starting the first one right now.
- I'd better bring you another one.

246
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,413
Mayo, please.

247
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:51,190
Thank you, Deane.

248
00:30:04,308 --> 00:30:05,639
What are his chances?

249
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:07,276
No more than 50-50.

250
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:11,174
We stopped the hemorrhaging, but they
got some of the major blood vessels.

251
00:30:11,248 --> 00:30:12,613
Thank you, Doctor.

252
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:22,883
How is he doing?

253
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:24,045
Holding.

254
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:25,883
Stanton?

255
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:28,117
Okay. He's sleeping now.

256
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:30,251
I want to talk to you.

257
00:31:40,804 --> 00:31:42,738
I got the report back from the lab.

258
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:45,206
Nothing at the hotel.
How come they got in?

259
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:48,705
Ross got to the door,
unhooked the chain from the inside.

260
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,173
He let the killers in himself?
Why would he do a thing like that?

261
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:56,846
I'm waiting to ask him.

262
00:31:58,188 --> 00:32:00,656
What about the setup?
What do you think about that?

263
00:32:00,724 --> 00:32:03,557
Shotgun and a backup man.
Professionals.

264
00:32:04,328 --> 00:32:05,556
Yep.

265
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:16,699
I had to call Chalmers.

266
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:19,307
And?

267
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:22,307
It didn't go down too good.
It's the main event for him.

268
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:24,574
You know,
the Senate subcommittee hearing.

269
00:32:24,648 --> 00:32:27,310
He can't produce the big surprise
he promised everyone.

270
00:32:27,384 --> 00:32:30,512
He may try to make up some mileage
by laying it on us.

271
00:32:32,156 --> 00:32:33,817
Play it by the book from now on.

272
00:32:35,993 --> 00:32:38,052
Does Chalmers run the case, or do I?

273
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:40,463
All I'm interested in is results.

274
00:32:41,165 --> 00:32:42,792
Do whatever you think is best.

275
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,099
I'll try to back you up.

276
00:33:05,189 --> 00:33:08,488
Excuse me, sir.
Are you the policeman who hasn't eaten?

277
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:09,684
Yes, ma'am.

278
00:33:10,427 --> 00:33:11,792
- Thank you.
- Surely.

279
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:38,449
Where is he?

280
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:01,942
How is he, Doctor?

281
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:05,378
As well as can be expected.
He's still under the anesthesia.

282
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:06,714
I'm Walter Chalmers.

283
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:10,617
Is there any possibility of my getting
a deposition from Ross before Monday?

284
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:14,680
That's impossible to say at this time.
He may remain in shock.

285
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:18,054
I thank you for doing all you can, Doctor.

286
00:34:21,698 --> 00:34:23,188
Get the supervisor.

287
00:34:33,911 --> 00:34:35,902
Now, what went wrong, Lieutenant?

288
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:39,579
- Who else knew where he was?
- What?

289
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,408
Who else knew where he was?

290
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:44,982
What are you implying?

291
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:49,420
They knew where to look for him
and they used your name to get in.

292
00:34:52,162 --> 00:34:55,097
Are you suggesting
I disclosed his whereabouts?

293
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:56,727
Somebody did.

294
00:34:57,367 --> 00:34:58,891
And it didn't come from us.

295
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,497
That's hardly the issue.

296
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:04,897
Well, it certainly is.

297
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,472
I've got an officer with a family.

298
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:12,675
And he's shot up pretty bad.

299
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:16,848
And I've got a witness who can't talk.

300
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:21,780
I want to know about Ross.
What was the deal you made with him?

301
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:22,948
Deal?

302
00:35:25,295 --> 00:35:28,128
Lieutenant, don't try to evade
the responsibility.

303
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,828
In your parlance, you blew it.

304
00:35:33,036 --> 00:35:35,095
You knew the significance
of his testimony.

305
00:35:35,172 --> 00:35:38,164
Yet you failed to take
adequate measures to protect him.

306
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:41,436
So to you it was a job. No more.

307
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:47,107
Were it more, and you had the dedication
I was led to believe... .

308
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:49,512
You believe what you want.

309
00:35:49,987 --> 00:35:53,150
You work your side of the street
and I'll work mine.

310
00:35:57,861 --> 00:36:01,695
Lieutenant, I shall personally
officiate at your public crucifixion...

311
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:04,461
...if Ross doesn't recover
during the course of the hearing...

312
00:36:04,534 --> 00:36:06,559
...so I can at least present his deposition.

313
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:11,166
And, I assure you, I shall not suffer
the consequence of your incompetence.

314
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:13,773
And even if there wasn't any...

315
00:36:15,012 --> 00:36:18,004
...l'm rather certain
I can prove negligence on your part.

316
00:36:23,654 --> 00:36:25,679
There may be another attempt on his life.

317
00:36:25,756 --> 00:36:29,192
I'll be back in the morning,
with my people.

318
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:33,989
Thank you, Doctor.

319
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:47,900
I'd like to have Dr. Williard replaced.
I think he's too young and inexperienced.

320
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:49,536
I prefer my surgeon.

321
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,079
Inform the administrator.

322
00:36:51,148 --> 00:36:52,479
But Dr. Williard is one of our--

323
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:55,109
I'd like him replaced, if you don't mind.

324
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:44,966
A relative of mine,
he's here with a gunshot wound.

325
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:47,060
Could you please tell me
where I can find him?

326
00:37:47,137 --> 00:37:49,332
Why don't you try at the reception desk?

327
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:50,703
There's no one there.

328
00:37:50,774 --> 00:37:53,937
He could be up on the second floor
in the emergency room.

329
00:38:05,222 --> 00:38:07,622
Oh, Lieutenant. It's for you.

330
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:15,156
Thank you.

331
00:38:16,566 --> 00:38:17,362
Yes?

332
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:20,096
Dr. Kenner. This probably isn't important...

333
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:22,530
...but a man asked me
whether a relative of his...

334
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:24,267
...with a gunshot wound
was in the hospital.

335
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:26,172
I thought you should know about it.

336
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:29,670
Was he about 5 foot 10? Gray hair?

337
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,176
I'm afraid I told him
that he was on the second floor.

338
00:38:33,283 --> 00:38:34,375
Thank you.

339
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:41,281
Delgetti.

340
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:44,191
Our man is in the building.
He was tipped where to find Ross.

341
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:46,855
- You take the ground floor, okay?
- Got it.

342
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:57,062
Get in Ross's room. Nobody in
except Dr. Williard and the nurses.

343
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,920
There's a man down the stairs!

344
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:21,561
Polly, call Anesthesia
and bring the crash cart!

345
00:43:24,307 --> 00:43:26,707
Doctor, there's a cardiac arrest in ICU.

346
00:44:00,777 --> 00:44:03,211
Get Delgetti. You and the patrolman
cover the lobby.

347
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:04,177
Okay.

348
00:44:10,954 --> 00:44:12,353
I can't get a blood pressure.

349
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,614
Go.

350
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:17,985
Do you want to defibrillate again?

351
00:44:18,661 --> 00:44:21,562
Not now. Not with that complex.

352
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:30,032
Go ahead. Push it in.

353
00:44:32,008 --> 00:44:32,997
Dress him up.

354
00:44:33,243 --> 00:44:36,701
- Any pupillary reaction?
- No. Dilated.

355
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,045
Get some calcium up, too.

356
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,591
What's that now? What's he got?

357
00:44:54,731 --> 00:44:55,959
No activity.

358
00:45:21,624 --> 00:45:22,852
I need your help.

359
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:24,585
What is it?

360
00:45:28,198 --> 00:45:29,631
I want this kept open.

361
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:32,725
If Chalmers finds out that Ross died,
he's going to fold this up.

362
00:45:32,802 --> 00:45:34,736
And I want the man that killed him!

363
00:45:34,804 --> 00:45:35,828
I understand.

364
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:37,202
I don't want your head on a block.

365
00:45:37,273 --> 00:45:38,365
I understand.

366
00:45:40,276 --> 00:45:42,676
His chart could be misplaced.

367
00:45:43,546 --> 00:45:46,879
You filed it. It's missing.
I'll take the responsibility.

368
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:52,184
All right.

369
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:06,797
Call the coroner's office.
Tell them to put Ross under a John Doe.

370
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:10,100
I want a private ambulance,
unmarked, and I want it quiet.

371
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,083
Far as you go, Doctor.

372
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,152
Take it slow.

373
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:17,732
City morgue.

374
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:19,206
Let's go.

375
00:48:54,404 --> 00:48:55,496
Fresh today!

376
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:07,502
See if Dr. Williard is still in the hospital.

377
00:50:07,577 --> 00:50:09,374
Get Lt. Bullitt on the phone.

378
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:19,454
I'm sorry, Joe. He's been transferred
to another room.

379
00:50:22,158 --> 00:50:23,648
May I have an outside line, please?

380
00:50:23,726 --> 00:50:26,024
May I speak to your supervisor, please?

381
00:50:26,295 --> 00:50:28,058
I'm afraid she's busy at the moment.

382
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,429
I'd be grateful if you would tell her
that Chalmers wishes to see her.

383
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:33,366
Immediately. It's very urgent.

384
00:50:33,703 --> 00:50:35,193
Yes, Mr. Chalmers.

385
00:50:39,442 --> 00:50:42,070
I'd like to speak with Dr. Williard, please.

386
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:43,073
Thank you.

387
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,014
Yes? Can I help you?

388
00:50:56,759 --> 00:50:58,158
I wanted the other supervisor.

389
00:50:58,227 --> 00:51:00,661
The night supervisor went off duty
an hour ago.

390
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,755
I'm Mrs. Francis. May I help you?

391
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:06,896
You may, indeed. There was
a patient here. His name is Johnny Ross.

392
00:51:07,303 --> 00:51:10,295
- And he seems to have, disappeared.
- Disappeared?

393
00:51:10,573 --> 00:51:14,669
He was in Intensive Care, but there's no
record of his whereabouts in the hospital.

394
00:51:14,744 --> 00:51:15,733
That's impossible.

395
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:17,870
May I see his medical chart, please?

396
00:51:17,947 --> 00:51:19,676
I'm sorry but hospital regulations--

397
00:51:19,749 --> 00:51:23,014
It's an official police request.
Is it not, Captain Baker?

398
00:51:25,021 --> 00:51:27,251
Yes, Captain. I'll take care of it.

399
00:51:30,226 --> 00:51:32,956
Excuse me, but Dr. Williard
has gone off duty.

400
00:51:33,462 --> 00:51:34,520
Call him at home.

401
00:51:36,432 --> 00:51:38,229
Are you sure he's not there?

402
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:40,594
Do you have Dr. Williard's home number?

403
00:51:42,772 --> 00:51:44,296
I'm sorry, but there has been...

404
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:46,671
...some medical complication
as regard to my witness.

405
00:51:46,742 --> 00:51:49,575
I'm afraid I'll have to forego
that bedside picture...

406
00:51:49,645 --> 00:51:52,705
...as much as it would've compensated
for his inability to testify tomorrow.

407
00:51:52,782 --> 00:51:55,114
But, in all decency,
I can hardly force the issue.

408
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,748
Does this mean your surprise witness
won't be able to make any statement?

409
00:52:00,823 --> 00:52:03,223
The man was near death
when he was brought in here.

410
00:52:03,292 --> 00:52:04,987
In view of the attempt on his life...

411
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:06,961
...l'm sure you can understand
my reasons for secrecy.

412
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:09,293
- Yeah, of course.
- Good to see you again.

413
00:52:12,501 --> 00:52:13,900
Can't reach Lt. Bullitt, either.

414
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,301
Keep trying.

415
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:20,098
I can't find Mr. Ross's medical chart.
It's evidently been misplaced.

416
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:21,768
- Or appropriated.
- Appropriated?

417
00:52:22,111 --> 00:52:25,672
All right. I'll inform the administrator.
Thank you very much.

418
00:52:28,351 --> 00:52:31,184
I want a complete list of the staff
who might've been involved...

419
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:33,744
...in helping Bullitt spirit Johnny Ross
out of here.

420
00:52:33,823 --> 00:52:36,656
I'm certain he grabbed my witness
for his personal aggrandizement.

421
00:52:36,726 --> 00:52:38,887
- I'll lay odds on that.
- And find Ross!

422
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:40,121
I'll get on that right away.

423
00:52:40,196 --> 00:52:42,323
Mr. Chalmers, I have Lt. Bullitt.

424
00:52:48,304 --> 00:52:49,669
Where's my witness?

425
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:52,665
I've got him.

426
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:53,998
Where is he?

427
00:52:55,678 --> 00:52:57,407
Are you going to tell me or not?

428
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:00,840
Well, I can't at the present time.

429
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:05,185
Captain Baker would like
to have a word with you.

430
00:53:08,357 --> 00:53:10,348
Now, listen to me, Lieutenant.

431
00:53:13,496 --> 00:53:15,361
Nail him. I want him written off.

432
00:53:15,431 --> 00:53:16,693
No problem.

433
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:23,029
You want some breakfast?

434
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:25,701
Just coffee.

435
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:18,091
Thank you.

436
00:54:20,996 --> 00:54:21,963
For what?

437
00:54:41,517 --> 00:54:43,178
- Is it open?
- The door's open, sir.

438
00:56:03,265 --> 00:56:07,326
Now think back to the time the two
of them first came in and you saw them.

439
00:56:07,403 --> 00:56:09,166
Anything you can remember?

440
00:56:09,805 --> 00:56:13,172
Like I said. They hit me
before I got a chance to look at them.

441
00:56:13,342 --> 00:56:15,776
I don't remember nothin'
about them. Nothin'.

442
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:18,510
Start remembering.

443
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:19,870
I can't!

444
00:56:20,716 --> 00:56:22,274
And that's the honest truth.

445
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:24,342
Delgetti, take him downtown.

446
00:56:25,287 --> 00:56:28,188
Lieutenant, give him a chance, will you?
He's trying.

447
00:56:28,257 --> 00:56:29,849
He's not trying hard enough.

448
00:56:31,227 --> 00:56:32,694
It will come to him.

449
00:56:34,797 --> 00:56:36,389
You're wasting your time.

450
00:56:42,471 --> 00:56:43,529
Okay. Come on.

451
00:56:45,374 --> 00:56:47,365
One thing about the guy who hit me... .

452
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,141
He had a square face.

453
00:56:51,547 --> 00:56:55,039
There wasn't much light here.
They try to save on electricity.

454
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,678
Like this?

455
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:07,017
No. Thinner.

456
00:57:10,432 --> 00:57:11,399
That's it.

457
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:13,398
Now it's coming back.

458
00:57:14,036 --> 00:57:17,494
Let's go to the guy in 634. No luggage?

459
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,068
That's right, sir.

460
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:21,805
- And he didn't store anything?
- No, sir.

461
00:57:22,077 --> 00:57:24,910
He came in empty, which means
you gave him a good look-over.

462
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,574
Always do. They're the ones
I give the eye to.

463
00:57:28,217 --> 00:57:29,912
Then you saw how he arrived?

464
00:57:29,985 --> 00:57:31,247
Yes, sir. In a cab.

465
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,744
What line?

466
00:57:32,955 --> 00:57:34,252
Sunshine Cab.

467
00:57:37,526 --> 00:57:39,926
Now, the guy who hit you.
How old was he?

468
00:57:39,995 --> 00:57:41,087
Oh, about 50.

469
00:57:41,864 --> 00:57:43,024
What was his hair like?

470
00:57:43,098 --> 00:57:45,589
Gray. Getting bald. Bald on both sides.

471
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:47,264
That?

472
00:57:47,336 --> 00:57:48,530
No, balder.

473
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:50,535
Am I helping you, sir?

474
00:57:51,307 --> 00:57:52,604
I never had it so good.

475
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,150
His first stop was the Mark.

476
00:58:46,695 --> 00:58:47,627
How long?

477
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:48,819
Not long.

478
00:58:49,665 --> 00:58:50,996
Pull over there and wait.

479
00:59:39,181 --> 00:59:40,512
- Hello.
- Eddy?

480
00:59:41,283 --> 00:59:45,049
Dues time. I need some information
on a Johnny Ross. Chicago.

481
00:59:46,155 --> 00:59:48,715
Give me half an hour.
Meet you at Enrico's.

482
00:59:49,391 --> 00:59:50,323
Right.

483
01:00:00,636 --> 01:00:02,934
- Two.
- Two what?

484
01:00:03,172 --> 01:00:06,073
Calls. He called twice.
The second was long distance.

485
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:08,400
How do you know it was long distance?

486
01:00:09,478 --> 01:00:11,343
He put in a lot of change.

487
01:00:40,175 --> 01:00:43,144
Good morning, Sam.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

488
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:45,403
This is Mr. Chalmers.
My wife, Mrs. Bennet.

489
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:47,108
My son, Paul. My son, Tony.

490
01:00:47,282 --> 01:00:48,112
Tony, how are you?

491
01:00:48,717 --> 01:00:51,208
Would you mind if I had
just a moment alone with Sam?

492
01:00:51,286 --> 01:00:52,446
No, of course not.

493
01:00:56,024 --> 01:00:59,118
Must be difficult raising children
in the world of today.

494
01:00:59,828 --> 01:01:02,126
I presume Tony is a college student.

495
01:01:02,831 --> 01:01:04,128
Yes, that's right.

496
01:01:05,534 --> 01:01:07,559
I can well imagine the financial strain...

497
01:01:07,636 --> 01:01:10,503
...of sending a boy to the university
on the salary of a captain.

498
01:01:10,572 --> 01:01:12,733
But there's no reason why a man
with your potential...

499
01:01:12,808 --> 01:01:15,606
...shouldn't move right up,
given the right support.

500
01:01:17,112 --> 01:01:19,637
My family is waiting for me, Mr. Chalmers.

501
01:01:21,717 --> 01:01:23,651
Bullitt abducted my witness.

502
01:01:24,786 --> 01:01:26,583
He removed him from the hospital.

503
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:30,318
As his superior officer, I've given him
complete charge of the case.

504
01:01:30,759 --> 01:01:33,159
If he's moving Ross around,
it's for a reason.

505
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:38,666
So you mean that you would not order
him to reveal where he's keeping Ross?

506
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:40,494
It's his case, Mr. Chalmers.

507
01:01:43,906 --> 01:01:47,000
Captain, I'm serving you with
a writ of habeas corpus...

508
01:01:48,443 --> 01:01:51,344
...making you responsible
for the delivery of Ross.

509
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:54,346
Duly observed...

510
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,340
...you have received it.

511
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,351
Now I need that witness
to prove his very existence.

512
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:07,020
Excuse me, sir. Dad, Mom is waiting.

513
01:02:07,196 --> 01:02:09,858
Would you excuse us
for just another moment, Tony?

514
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:15,068
I do not choose to have people
accuse me of false promises...

515
01:02:15,137 --> 01:02:17,230
...for the sake of cheap sensationalism...

516
01:02:17,306 --> 01:02:20,707
...or to be compromised
by your lieutenant. Or castrated.

517
01:02:45,033 --> 01:02:46,728
Wait for me. I won't be long.

518
01:03:40,522 --> 01:03:43,787
According to my sources,
the Organization, Chicago branch...

519
01:03:44,493 --> 01:03:47,291
...caught Johnny Ross
with his hands in the till.

520
01:03:47,496 --> 01:03:48,656
They estimate he siphoned off...

521
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:51,961
...about two million bucks
while operating their wire service.

522
01:03:52,034 --> 01:03:56,027
The story is they tried to get rid of him.
Friday night. Chicago.

523
01:03:57,306 --> 01:03:58,136
Chicago?

524
01:03:58,774 --> 01:04:02,141
He got away unharmed.
They believe he's hiding here in town.

525
01:04:02,678 --> 01:04:04,509
How old is this information, Eddy?

526
01:04:04,579 --> 01:04:07,810
Four hours. They're looking for him
all over town, Frank.

527
01:04:08,283 --> 01:04:12,652
They've staked out the docks, the airport,
to keep him from leaving the country.

528
01:04:13,322 --> 01:04:15,313
Anyone else trying for a hit?

529
01:04:16,358 --> 01:04:18,121
Haven't heard of any such likelihood.

530
01:04:18,327 --> 01:04:19,658
What about his brother, Pete?

531
01:04:20,162 --> 01:04:21,151
In the clear.

532
01:04:23,298 --> 01:04:24,822
Okay, Eddy. Thanks.

533
01:04:25,834 --> 01:04:27,199
Anything I can do for you?

534
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:28,600
There is something.

535
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:31,503
Remember Zash-zhoe?
They gave him three to five.

536
01:04:32,274 --> 01:04:33,104
What is he in for?

537
01:04:33,175 --> 01:04:34,665
Receiving stolen property.

538
01:04:36,244 --> 01:04:37,108
I'll try.

539
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:38,978
Thanks, Frank.

540
01:05:02,437 --> 01:05:05,065
- Here you go.
- Take care, Lieutenant.

541
01:16:16,677 --> 01:16:18,645
What the hell is going on here?

542
01:16:19,047 --> 01:16:20,412
A high-speed pursuit!

543
01:16:20,515 --> 01:16:24,315
And two men are killed. An officer in
the hospital. A witness almost murdered.

544
01:16:24,385 --> 01:16:26,353
I want to know what's happening,
and I want to know now!

545
01:16:26,421 --> 01:16:27,285
Let's hear it straight.

546
01:16:27,355 --> 01:16:28,515
Here's the report.

547
01:16:30,858 --> 01:16:34,521
Now, a man like Chalmers could be
a great help to the Department.

548
01:16:35,196 --> 01:16:37,528
He could speak for us where it counts.

549
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:40,356
He could fight for us in the legislature.

550
01:16:40,701 --> 01:16:43,295
Now, you have got to
turn over his witness.

551
01:16:45,373 --> 01:16:46,601
Where's Ross?

552
01:16:49,377 --> 01:16:51,208
Tell him! That's an order!

553
01:16:55,383 --> 01:16:56,543
He's dead.

554
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:58,040
Dead?

555
01:16:58,386 --> 01:16:59,876
He died last night.

556
01:17:00,054 --> 01:17:01,146
After you moved him?

557
01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:04,680
Before. I've got him downstairs
under a John Doe.

558
01:17:07,395 --> 01:17:08,885
You are sick.

559
01:17:10,064 --> 01:17:12,897
Smuggling a dead man out of a hospital.

560
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:17,560
And now two men killed
who may have had nothing to do with it.

561
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:19,899
The man I was chasing killed Ross.

562
01:17:20,074 --> 01:17:22,065
How do you know? Did you see him?

563
01:17:22,243 --> 01:17:24,575
Yes. He tried to nail me with a shotgun.

564
01:17:24,912 --> 01:17:26,573
A Winchester pump.

565
01:17:30,084 --> 01:17:33,747
The radio report said the two men
were burned beyond recognition.

566
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:38,919
Now all he's got are two dead men.
It would never hold up in court.

567
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:42,922
I've got one lead. I want to move on it.

568
01:17:48,436 --> 01:17:51,769
"Miss Dorothy Simmons.
Thunderbolt Hotel. San Mateo."

569
01:17:52,773 --> 01:17:56,368
Ross called her person-to-person
from a phone booth in Union Square...

570
01:17:56,444 --> 01:17:58,878
...approximately nine hours
before he was killed.

571
01:17:58,946 --> 01:18:01,608
So he called his girlfriend.
What does that prove?

572
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:16,829
This is Sunday. I'm going to hold that writ
until we come to work Monday morning.

573
01:18:30,745 --> 01:18:31,712
Frank?

574
01:18:35,816 --> 01:18:37,147
Go on. Get out.

575
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:54,166
Need a car.

576
01:18:54,335 --> 01:18:56,826
Sorry, Lieutenant, there are no cars left.

577
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:03,559
Ms. Simmons doesn't answer.

578
01:20:03,904 --> 01:20:05,064
What's her room number?

579
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:07,634
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to give... .

580
01:20:08,042 --> 01:20:11,375
Front. Take this gentleman
to Room 114, please.

581
01:21:46,807 --> 01:21:48,001
Hello, Dell?

582
01:21:49,477 --> 01:21:51,445
Yeah. Yeah.

583
01:21:52,113 --> 01:21:53,239
It's a strangulation.

584
01:23:28,242 --> 01:23:29,732
I thought I knew you.

585
01:23:30,778 --> 01:23:32,541
But I'm not so sure anymore.

586
01:23:34,849 --> 01:23:38,615
Do you let anything reach you?
I mean, really reach you?

587
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:43,521
Or are you so used to it by now
that nothing really touches you?

588
01:23:43,791 --> 01:23:45,622
You're living in a sewer, Frank.

589
01:23:46,327 --> 01:23:47,624
Day after day.

590
01:23:49,964 --> 01:23:53,127
That's where half of it is.
And we can't walk away from it.

591
01:23:53,934 --> 01:23:57,461
I know it's there, but I don't have to
be reminded of the whole thing.

592
01:23:57,805 --> 01:23:59,466
The ugliness around us!

593
01:23:59,974 --> 01:24:03,808
With you, violence is a way of life,
living with violence and death.

594
01:24:11,585 --> 01:24:15,248
How can you be part of it without
becoming more and more callous?

595
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:22,995
Your world is so far from the one I know.

596
01:24:30,037 --> 01:24:31,664
What will happen to us in time?

597
01:24:36,977 --> 01:24:38,342
Time starts now.

598
01:24:50,057 --> 01:24:52,116
- What do you got?
- Let's start with the cleaver.

599
01:24:52,192 --> 01:24:56,026
One cleaver, approximately
eight inches in length.

600
01:24:57,464 --> 01:25:00,126
Ms. Simmons's luggage
has just arrived from the airport.

601
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,064
Okay.

602
01:25:01,802 --> 01:25:03,133
Where is it?

603
01:25:04,805 --> 01:25:07,171
Here you go. One pair of gold shoes... .

604
01:25:07,241 --> 01:25:08,265
Where is it from?

605
01:25:08,342 --> 01:25:10,037
San Mateo Thunderbolt Hotel.

606
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,771
- And who from?
- Simmons.

607
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:13,468
And what do we have?

608
01:25:13,547 --> 01:25:16,380
One yellow metal locket.
Yellow metal watch.

609
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:19,383
Pearl necklace. Put a hold on these.

610
01:25:51,085 --> 01:25:52,416
We got a man here.

611
01:25:59,226 --> 01:26:01,786
Dearborn Travel Agency in Chicago. Rome.

612
01:26:03,397 --> 01:26:04,694
Look at all this literature!

613
01:26:11,005 --> 01:26:14,031
What do you make out of that?
I thought she was alone.

614
01:26:15,209 --> 01:26:16,267
She's got a guy, now.

615
01:26:24,218 --> 01:26:26,118
New purse, still has a price tag in it.

616
01:26:38,732 --> 01:26:39,790
Give me a bag, Tony.

617
01:26:52,513 --> 01:26:54,981
Everything is new.
They weren't even away.

618
01:26:58,886 --> 01:27:01,446
- Passport?
- No passport. No tickets.

619
01:27:01,822 --> 01:27:03,915
Yeah, I don't find any tickets, either.

620
01:27:14,368 --> 01:27:15,232
Bingo!

621
01:27:19,707 --> 01:27:20,674
Great.

622
01:27:23,377 --> 01:27:25,470
Albert E. Renick.

623
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:29,109
Then who the hell is Simmons?

624
01:27:32,186 --> 01:27:33,778
Look how much money he's got.

625
01:27:34,121 --> 01:27:35,088
Look at this.

626
01:27:40,961 --> 01:27:42,258
This guy is loaded!

627
01:27:43,197 --> 01:27:44,687
Well, we've got a Renick.

628
01:27:45,499 --> 01:27:47,023
Wonder who Renick is?

629
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:51,499
Look what I came up with!

630
01:27:54,608 --> 01:27:55,575
Dorothy Renick.

631
01:27:57,177 --> 01:27:58,872
Okay. Drop it in.

632
01:28:01,081 --> 01:28:02,673
We're getting warm. A.R.

633
01:28:04,051 --> 01:28:05,348
How does that grab you?

634
01:28:09,056 --> 01:28:12,583
Give me a bag, Tony.
Fingerprints on this stuff.

635
01:28:18,198 --> 01:28:19,358
Let's wrap it up.

636
01:28:30,511 --> 01:28:31,671
- Thanks, John.
- Okay.

637
01:28:33,547 --> 01:28:34,741
No tickets, no passport.

638
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,951
Call lmmigration in Chicago. Have them
wire Renick's passport applications.

639
01:28:44,024 --> 01:28:46,584
- I'll get a fingerprint check on Ross, huh?
- Okay.

640
01:28:48,695 --> 01:28:51,823
There are multiple gunshot wounds
of the left side of the face...

641
01:28:51,899 --> 01:28:55,198
...the left side of the neck
at about the left upper thorax.

642
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:58,636
These extend from the lateral extent
of the left eye...

643
01:28:58,772 --> 01:29:01,605
...and a portion of the left orbit
has been lacerated...

644
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:04,803
...and aqueous humor
protrudes from the laceration.

645
01:29:05,212 --> 01:29:08,045
There have been deep lacerations
in the immediate area.

646
01:29:08,148 --> 01:29:11,481
And these have been approximated
by fine surgical sutures.

647
01:29:11,952 --> 01:29:15,649
There are multiple surgical incisions
about the left side of the face.

648
01:29:15,722 --> 01:29:18,156
There is considerable hemorrhage
in these deep tissues...

649
01:29:18,225 --> 01:29:21,752
...and a number of surgical sutures
are present about this area.

650
01:29:21,995 --> 01:29:25,021
There are entrances into the sinuses...

651
01:29:25,098 --> 01:29:28,033
...and several pellets are found
located within this area.

652
01:29:28,302 --> 01:29:32,363
There are also multiple lacerations
and multiple gunshot entrance wounds...

653
01:29:32,439 --> 01:29:33,997
...about the left side of the neck.

654
01:29:34,141 --> 01:29:38,168
And similar wounds are found
on the left upper thorax.

655
01:29:39,079 --> 01:29:41,240
Would you send up
those prints right away?

656
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:03,368
I understand that Captain Bennet told
you, you had until Monday morning...

657
01:30:03,437 --> 01:30:05,530
...to comply with
my writ of habeas corpus.

658
01:30:05,606 --> 01:30:07,301
However, I want a signed admission now...

659
01:30:07,374 --> 01:30:09,808
...that Ross died
while he was in your custody.

660
01:30:11,278 --> 01:30:13,178
When I'm ready. Yes?

661
01:30:13,513 --> 01:30:15,276
Your photographs are coming through.

662
01:30:15,349 --> 01:30:16,839
I'll be right up. Thank you.

663
01:30:17,351 --> 01:30:20,013
I demand that signed statement. Now.

664
01:30:23,056 --> 01:30:24,080
Excuse me.

665
01:30:49,716 --> 01:30:50,705
Is that the girl?

666
01:30:52,653 --> 01:30:53,312
Yeah.

667
01:32:03,323 --> 01:32:03,982
Ross.

668
01:32:04,758 --> 01:32:06,282
Albert Edward Renick.

669
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:08,790
Used car salesman. Chicago.

670
01:32:10,897 --> 01:32:11,886
Who is Renick?

671
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:15,267
He was the man who was shot
in the Hotel Daniels.

672
01:32:15,335 --> 01:32:17,769
You sent us to guard
the wrong man, Mr. Chalmers.

673
01:32:28,982 --> 01:32:30,973
Mrs. Dorothy Renick and Mr. Al Renick...

674
01:32:31,051 --> 01:32:33,246
...have reservations
on the seven o'clock flight to Rome.

675
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,981
Separate tickets. Not confirmed.

676
01:32:35,288 --> 01:32:37,119
And I got this report from Chicago.

677
01:32:37,257 --> 01:32:40,317
Renick has no record of arrests.
He's clean, Frank.

678
01:32:42,095 --> 01:32:45,394
Ross took close to $2,000,000
from the Organization.

679
01:32:45,465 --> 01:32:48,093
And he set Renick up
to get the heat off of him.

680
01:32:48,502 --> 01:32:50,993
Then he killed Renick's wife
to shut her up.

681
01:33:36,616 --> 01:33:38,243
San Francisco Homicide.

682
01:33:38,485 --> 01:33:41,545
Do you have a Mr. Renick
on the seven o'clock flight for Rome?

683
01:33:42,255 --> 01:33:43,916
He confirmed his flight
a half hour ago.

684
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:45,014
Did he check in yet?

685
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:48,424
Not here, but he could do that at the gate.
Shall I call Security?

686
01:33:48,495 --> 01:33:52,522
Call the gate. Have them recheck
all the passports. Which gate?

687
01:33:52,966 --> 01:33:54,228
Seventy-three.

688
01:34:03,343 --> 01:34:04,970
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

689
01:34:05,045 --> 01:34:07,809
Clipper Flight 110 is now ready
for boarding.

690
01:34:08,682 --> 01:34:12,778
We hope you have a pleasant flight
and thank you for choosing Pan American.

691
01:34:13,153 --> 01:34:15,519
No smoking, please, beyond this point.

692
01:34:15,722 --> 01:34:19,214
Would you please have
your passports available for inspection...

693
01:34:19,292 --> 01:34:21,726
...as you pass through the departure gate?

694
01:35:30,497 --> 01:35:34,524
And you're with the tour, too, are you?
There are other girls ahead of you.

695
01:35:34,601 --> 01:35:36,398
Step right on through.

696
01:36:27,187 --> 01:36:28,381
Passenger Service.

697
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:29,545
Can I help you, sir?

698
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:34,393
Do you have a Renick, an Al E. Renick,
Flight 124 to London?

699
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:41,632
What?

700
01:36:43,069 --> 01:36:46,835
Thank you. At the last minute,
on a Rome ticket. Flight Control.

701
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:30,245
Ladies and gentlemen, we have just
been instructed to return to the gate.

702
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:32,450
For your safety, please remain seated...

703
01:37:32,519 --> 01:37:34,987
...until the aircraft has come
to a complete stop.

704
01:37:35,322 --> 01:37:37,483
We anticipate only a short delay.

705
01:37:37,824 --> 01:37:40,759
However, all passengers are requested
to disembark...

706
01:37:40,827 --> 01:37:43,523
...and remain in the departure lounge.
Thank you.

707
01:38:35,215 --> 01:38:36,876
He's still my witness.

708
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:41,042
I'll be delighted to let you have him
after he testifies tomorrow.

709
01:38:57,737 --> 01:38:59,068
The Organization.

710
01:39:00,073 --> 01:39:01,563
Several murders.

711
01:39:02,409 --> 01:39:04,240
Could do us both a great deal of good.

712
01:39:04,744 --> 01:39:08,236
Look, Chalmers, let's understand
each other. I don't like you.

713
01:39:09,249 --> 01:39:11,740
Come on now, don't be naive, Lieutenant.

714
01:39:12,252 --> 01:39:14,413
We both know how careers are made.

715
01:39:15,088 --> 01:39:17,352
Integrity is something
you sell to the public.

716
01:39:17,424 --> 01:39:20,416
You sell whatever you want,
but don't sell it here, tonight.

717
01:39:22,429 --> 01:39:25,523
- Frank, we must all compromise.
- Bullshit.

718
01:39:29,469 --> 01:39:31,596
Get the hell out of here. Now!

719
01:41:09,702 --> 01:41:11,033
How long will we be delayed?

720
01:41:11,104 --> 01:41:13,038
Just about 45 minutes.

721
01:41:35,562 --> 01:41:36,756
Won't be long.

722
01:44:14,387 --> 01:44:16,048
Get me the security guard!

723
01:50:00,533 --> 01:50:01,727
Ticket, please.

724
01:50:24,957 --> 01:50:26,652
All right. Get back. Get back.

725
01:51:02,761 --> 01:51:05,423
Wonder who he was? What he did?

726
01:51:10,436 --> 01:51:12,495
I heard the shot
all the way down the hall.

727
01:51:12,571 --> 01:51:13,663
He's a cop. That's what he is.

728
01:51:13,739 --> 01:51:17,266
Let's get back. Let's get back.
Let's keep the area clear.

729
01:51:18,744 --> 01:51:21,235
Now, ladies,
you don't want to see this now.
