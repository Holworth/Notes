Hello everyone, 

I hope you have had a happy CNY vocation, following are my ideas about *Bullitt*.

## Bullitt: Cold isolated cop

The first thing to mention is Bullitt, the hero cop. Different from former movies about police, *Bullitt* shapes a tough, independent policeman. The character of Bullitt is worth mentioning.

Bullitt in this movie is a wordless man, however, it does not mean he has some difficulty in integrating into the society, for we can see in the movie that he lives well with his wife, and works along well with his men. 

If I had to use a word to describe this movie, I would choose "restraint". The director avoided intense motional conflict in this movie, and Bullitt himself says only few words. Along with the Jazz music in the movie, the whole atmosphere of this movie is "cold and cool". The restrained atmosphere generated a special sense of aesthetic, which may improve the audiences' attitude towards the cops in the movie.

Bullitt in this movie follows a traditional pattern of western heros. He sacrificed his family in someways, and was not understood by his wife. These isolation emphasized his nobility, and saves him from the public's distrust towards the authority. Personally, I think it was a successful attempt to build a character of a cop which is welcomed by the public.

## Conflict between Bullitt and Chalmers

Summing up the two movies we have seen, they can be seen as a sign of the public's attitude towards the institutions is beginning to shift. I agree with Rebecca's idea that the movie conveys the feeling that there is something wrong with the higher level of the government. The conflict between Bullitt and Chalmers goes through the whole movie. We can see that after his man was shoot in mission, Bullitt in this movie start to doubt about Chalmers, who represents authorities in this movie. In Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, the two robbers just despise the authority and the laws, they choose to live as what they wish, we can seen this as a reflection of 1960s' thoughts of anti-authority. Yet in Bullitt, Bullitt also does not go on well with the authority, but what he does is for the society, or you can say, for social justice, and here is the difference. In 1960s, riots happened in different cities, and people protested against institutions for Vit War and other things. The former movie shows a negative resistance against the authority: just live the life you want. Bullitt gave out another choice: one can go against the authority for the sake of the public. That described the 1960s American society well: people are dissatisfied with the institutions yet they believe the can do something to pull the society into the right track.

## Attitudes towards vigilante cops 

As Daniel asked in his post, the second shot into the real Johnny Ross is a interesting question. In the reading material, three movies in that era are listed. These three movies (Bullitt (1968), Dirty Harry (1971), and The French Connection (1971) ) "feature rogue cops who are at odds with judges, lawyers, politicians, and their own bosses or colleagues", yet what is interesting is that their attitude towards vigilante cops. People are encouraged to go over the line of laws to do good things for their society/country. Yet the problem is: these out-lawed activities may lead to dangerous results. The three movies gave out different attitudes towards such activities. (For more detailed information, refer to P15, Bullitt and the Police Film)

So I think that is a good question. The second shot by Bullitt was Bullitt's deliberate vengeance for his colleague  and the scapegoat in my option. Here comes the question: if out-lawed activity is necessary for the goodness of a society, will unlimited vigilante things lead to a worse situation? In this movie, Bullitt's vengeance seems to be reasonable and fair, but it may also lead to the fail of Chalmers's case, which may cause more loss.

This is a precise mirror to American society in 1960s: on one hand, people stand up to voice for themselves, for the society, and for the country; on the other hand, these activities also lead to chaos of the society. So I think, in some ways, this reflects the contradictory attitude towards 1960s social movements.
