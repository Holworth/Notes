How can the job of policing be at once so hopeless and so assured
of success? This question mirrors a deeper contradiction in viewers’
attitudes toward the majesty of the law, their suspicion of the very legal system they are counting on to protect their welfare. The opening
situation of most police films typically engages viewers’ fears of the
law’s powerlessness, the weakness of the authority that gives it moral
and legal force, and the resulting lawless chaos; the final resolution
reflects their confidence in the law and the justice of its tactics, however violent, even lawless, they may seem. It is a primary task of police films to mediate between these two attitudes, expressing audiences’ skeptical fears about the justice system while leaving them
ultimately confident in its workings

犯罪分子踏入警察的私人领域: 复仇和公共正义之间的界限

像西方英雄，警察英雄
他被剥夺了家庭生活，以便将他从他应该捍卫的社会团体中边缘化，即使他的异化加强了他的专业奉献精神。

The most radical isolation between police heroes and their world
is achieved by driving a wedge between them and the corruption of untrustworthy colleagues in their own departments. 

(1985), and Cop Land (1997) s

film gradually reveals, both the police and the criminals are so deeply
immersed in a culture of violence that it is only by violent 

police films as heterosexual male audiences’ psychosexual anxieties
in private-eye films. “G” Men, produced at a time when a strong executive branch under President Franklin Roosevelt was attempting to
pull the nation out of widespread economic chaos, and released with
the imprimatur of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, mounts a spirited defense of the recent empowerment of FBI agents and their moral authority. The most problematic police films appear at times when the
police, and institutional authority generally, are under suspicion, and
especially when these suspicions are rooted in still deeper genera

tional conflicts concerning authority and the law. The crucial period
in the Hollywood police film is the late 1960s and early 1970s, not only
because it is a period of unprecedented economic freedom and formal
experimentation in American films generally,4 but because a spate of
rioting in Watts (1965), Detroit (1967), Newark (1967), and on innumerable college campuses – culminating in the National Guard’s killing
of four students at Ohio’s Kent State University (1970) – fed public debate about both police tactics and the legitimacy of the government
they represented.
