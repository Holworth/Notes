Young people replaced the old people and dominate the whole country, the model graduate lost his aim for life and had sex with a woman who was old enough to be his mother, two young people crossed America on their motorcycle aimlessly: *Easy Rider*, Wild in the Streets and *the Graduate* provide us a view from the sight of 1960s' American young people, make it possible for us to understand what was happening on the youth in 1960s' America. From that, we can get a glance of view on the importance of youth to American society in the 1960s: economically, politically, and what is the most important, culturally.


## Cultural importance

The most important thing is that the young in 1960s were forming a new culture in America. This is not limited to the hippies or the rock stars. The young people in 1960s were "drifting". In *Easy Rider*, the two riders fled from the normal life and cross the U.S. with no strong reason or clear aim. In Wild in the Streets, the young do things without a specific reason, it looks like they were just doing what they want to do. In *the Graduate*, which is the most obvious one, Ben is always drifting and do not know what to do next. The movie has many scenes that Ben was floating on the surface of water, or dave into the water to avoid other people. From the three movies we can see the young people in these movies were both not satisfied with the life they were living now, and did not have a clear view of the future. This can be seen as a cultural icon of 1960s. The young people were not satisfied with the life in suburb, and they were questioning about the American society.


The next thing is about the popular culture. Pop music, indulgence life style, abuse of drugs, sexual liberation... From these culture symbols used by both this three movies, we can learn that popular culture in 1960s was defined by the young generation.


The last but not the least, the three movies revealed the cultural conflict and cultural revolution in 1960s, which is called the counterculture movement later on. Young people were not bounded by material necessities of life because of the post-war affluence. Compared with the last generation, they thought more on the direction of the society. And some of them live a life unacceptable by the older generation.


The three movies showed other people's attitude towards those young "pioneers". In *the Graduate*: the parents were asking Ben to live on the normal track a Graduate student should live. In *Wild in the Streets*: The politicians are against the young's call to lower the age for taking part in election. In *Easy Rider*, many people are hostile against the young people who were not following the normal forms, and the two riders were finally killed by those people. To sum up, the young is in the center of cultural conflict. In fact, the cultural conflict is just between the new culture the young represents and the traditional culture the old represents. The young have a strong belief of their culture. Using the words in *Easy Rider*, those conservatives were afraid of freedom the two riders represents.


## Political importance

The three movies also showed how did the young people challenge the society. In *the Graduate*, Ben challenge the society wildly. He just avoided to live the life as it used to be, and "robed" his girlfriend from her wedding. In *Easy Rider*, the two riders get rid of their old life and go across the U.S. aimlessly. They even had a journey with a lawyer and taught him how to smoke Marijuana. In Wild in the Streets, the young just stand out for their rights (or more political power). They took part in the elections and asked for shifting the voting age.

 

This shows the fact that the young people are the core of those who are challenging traditional American societies. Though they were challenging the society in different ways, as mentioned above, many of them were calling for a break through from the traditional American society. Such thoughts lead to their positive actions about social affairs. For example: anti-war movement, civil rights movement, and more. And it made the politicians have to take the young as an important part of the society.

## Economical importance

In this part it is not about the plot of the movies, it is about the movies itself. The three movies were aiming at the young's market. They used the elements liked by the young and they tried to discuss about what the young care about. Both the three movies used popular songs. Wild in the Streets and *Easy Rider* talked about the hippies, drugs, and sex. From that we can see, as the young generation were dominating the popular culture, companies were also focusing on the need of the young people, which make the young more important economically.



## Conclusion

In conclusion, the importance of youth in 1960s America mainly is represented in three aspects: cultural aspect, political aspect and economical aspect. But among them, the most important one is the culture aspect. The young people in 1960s America lead up a new cultural wave, and we can still feel it's power even now. The rise of counterculture provided basic for the young's participate in politic and opened the market of young people. The young's political influence and economical influence were powered up by their cultural influence.


I would like to end up this passage by a scene in *the Graduate*. At the end of *the Graduate*, the Ben "robed" his girlfriend out of the church and got on a bus. They sat at the end of the bus, without knowing where the bus was heading, or what will their life in the future will be like. In the song of Scarborough Fair, the tow young looked at each other, then moved their heads towards ahead. It reflected the young individuals at that time. They loved, they got lost; they shouted, they rotted; they defined the main cultural symbol of 1960s with their drifting youth, and then moved on with both loss and hope.
