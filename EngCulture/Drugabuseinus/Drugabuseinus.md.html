## Focus--the new soft "drugs"

### What causes my interest in nitrous oxide abuse

* The new druglike problem: nitrous oxide abuse

* My concern about this comes from a recent new by Xinjing Paper about several Chinese students in America who get severe damage and wasted a large sum of money in nitrous oxide abuse.

For easy reference, Iput the full version of the letter here. 
我爸爸妈妈应该没有想到，我是坐着轮椅被工作人员推着出现在北京首都机场。他们当时震惊伤心的表情是我这辈子都不愿意去回想的画面。他们的宝贝女儿，送出国这么多年，学位没有拿到反而像个傻子一样被人送回来。他们开始自责这些年把我一个人放国外，对我的关心不够；我心里也难过，当初没碰气球应该多好。
不知道什么时候西雅图开始流行起了吹气球，微信里到处充斥着贩卖气球的留学生，对于没有抽过烟没有喝过酒的我很是新鲜。于是一直蠢蠢欲动，闺蜜拧不过我，带着我去烟店买了几盒所谓的气弹。我跟闺蜜发誓我就尝尝是什么感觉，可是第一次之后我就开始沦陷了。
那几个月我花了几十万去干这件毫无意义伤人害己的事情，一直到今天我都还是不能独自行走。我已经伤害了自己和家人朋友太多次，我看着周围同龄人该上学的上学，该工作的工作，该结婚的结婚，只有我一个人每天在医院过着这不正常的生活。
2016.11.12
我的心脏嘀了一下，我从睡梦中惊醒，我知道这是我的身体在提醒我不要死去。我迷迷糊糊的坐起来，看了看手机的十几条未读微信，我不知道我在半夜醒来要做什么，没有谈恋爱，没有去上学，在国外的日子浑浑噩噩。
我在思考我从哪里站起来，因为地上全都是外卖盒子，还有狗的屎尿。我小心翼翼的一步一步挪到沙发上坐下，嗓子痛的已经说不出话来，连喝水都困难。我的化妆桌上有几十只口红，有laduree的花瓣腮红，有香奈儿粉底液还有Lamer一整套的护肤品。我是一个很爱漂亮的女孩子，我最喜欢做的事情就是坐在那里打扮自己然后开开心心的跟朋友出去玩，可是我好像已经很久没出门了。
2016.11.18
我感觉我的手和脚都开始变得很麻，我想伸手去拿面前的杯子，拿不起来。我瘫坐在椅子上，用力呼吸满屋子的腐烂空气味。我突然觉得人活着真的好难，无时无刻都在胡思乱想甚至出现幻觉。过马路的时候被车撞倒就会死去，眼睛里面进了东西可能还会瞎，我的狗会不会在我睡觉的时候把我吃掉，我喝水喝多了会水中毒不喝会死，以后生孩子可能因为难产死去。
我越想越绝望，感觉随便做点什么都会发生意外。我突然觉得周围的一切变得好陌生，我看着我刚才想拿起来的杯子，我在想这是用来做什么的。我的手开始起泡脱皮，护手霜就在桌上，我懒得伸手去拿。头发都已经一个礼拜没有洗了，还能管手?
2016.11.20
我已经一个星期没有出门了，我准备好好的洗个澡带我的狗去附近的公园玩。我的狗因为害怕奶油瓶的巨大响声，已经跟我不是那么亲近了。奶油瓶把我的手弄得到处起皮，还把我的大腿冻出了一个大窟窿，但我还是每天15个小时拿着它。
我洗澡的时候发现我前胸和肚子上都有红色点点的小包，一片一片的，我有点冷漠的看着仿佛不是自己的身体，这一切好像显得不再重要。
2016.11.25
朋友来拖我出去逛街，说再不出门会闷死的。到了商场的停车场，下车闺蜜上来挽着我的手一起走。应该就15步，第15步的时候我扑通一下跪在地上。我以为我拌到了小石子摔跤了,我想站起来，却发现我竟然动不了我的双腿。我控制不住它们了，旁边的人赶快扶我起来，我刚站起来又扑通一下摔在了地上。
我的腿已经完全动不了了，他们帮我抬回家问我说我多喝点水，明天就能动了。我开始过上了爬行生活，我像动物一样爬着去卫生间，像动物一样爬着给送外卖的开门，我知道我现在在别人眼里毫无尊严。
2016.12.10
我好几天没有睡个踏实觉了，因为我的心脏在我睡着了以后会突然抖一下，而且我睡觉的时候开始不会自动呼吸了，我感觉我随时都可能猝死。我想到了我的爸爸妈妈，他们在我初中的时候就送我到国外接受最好的教育，我很爱他们。可是我醒来不知道自己在哪，周围一切好陌生...
2016.12.24
今天是美国的平安夜，外面很热闹。我却在我的床上看到了尿和大便，原来我大小便失禁了，空气里除了腐烂的食物现在还有恶臭味。我慢慢的回想着以前，有一次朋友在我床上吃东西掉下了一点渣渣，我立刻发毛把床单拿去洗了。我再看看满床的小便大便，算了就这样吧，不用爬着去卫生间了。我变成了大家都讨厌的人，因为满身的小便和大便。
2016.12.25
朋友来看我,进我房间立刻惊呼。我满身屎尿的被抬上了救护车，我出现了幻觉，感觉有人要追杀我。医生一直不停地问你叫什么名字，你年龄多大了，你知道现在是白天还是黑夜吗。
我想了半天，告诉他们我现在很难受，请他们去问我朋友关于我的信息。医生说NO，你自己回答。我又想了半天告诉他们我的名字，但是我忘记了我今年多大，还有我不知道现在是不是白天。我努力解释我在家睡着觉就被救护车抬来医院了，我不知道现在是什么时候。
医生说你冷静,先睡会。不知道睡了多久，被叫醒。医生又开始问你叫什么名字，你是哪一年出生的。我停顿了几秒觉得很生气，我说医生你觉得这样很好玩吗，这些问题这么幼稚为什么反复问。医生笑笑说，那你回答我啊。
我突然发现我忘了我叫什么，不对，我没有忘记我叫什么，是我根本听不懂医生在说什么了。我痴痴呆呆的坐在那里不回答医生，旁边的朋友看着一直在流眼泪...
2017.1.1
我被送回中国北京。
躺在医院里，我想想自己还挺年轻的。我想去学茶艺，去学给狗美容，还想去学修汽车。等我治疗康复了，我一定要去好多好多地方玩。热浪岛的海风，罗马的战场，法国的铁塔，在美好的青春里有大把大把事等着我去做。
但愿这一切我还来得及去完成吧。 -->

So we have to ask: what is the *balloon* mentioned in the letter, what kind of thing caused such a tragedy?
<!-- Where did I get to know about this. -->

Balloon, or blowing balloon, is the slang among the Chinese students in America, which refers to the act of using nitrous oxide for pleasure.

What is a whip-it? 
(resource: ibtimes)
(More information available at <http://www.ibtimes.com/nitrous-oxide-what-whip-it-party-drug-hospitalized-demi-moore-401114>)


<!-- 
A whip-it is a small metal canister, often used to recharge whipped cream cans in restaurants, that is used by high-seekers to extract the compressed nitrous oxide. Individuals inhale the nitrous oxide to achieve a euphoric feeling. Whip-it is the common street term. Other street names for inhalants include: laughing gas (nitrous oxide), snappers (amyl nitrite), poppers (amyl nitrite and butyl nitrite), whippets (fluorinated hydrocarbons, found in whipped cream dispensers), bold (nitrites), and rush (nitrites). 

It is used as a means to get high, most often by adolescents who want a cheap, quick thrill. Teenagers can easily buy such canisters over-the-counter at supermarkets. Whip-its sell at Wal-Mart. according to The NY Daily News.  -->

<!-- Who typically abuses inhalants? -->

<!-- (resource: ibtimes) -->
 
<!-- 
Inhalants are often among the first drugs that young adolescents abuse. In fact, they are one of the few classes of substances that are abused more by younger adolescents than older ones. Inhalant abuse can become chronic and continue into adulthood, according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse. 

The NIDA reports that inhalant abuse, such as with nitrous oxide, is most common amongst 7th through 9th graders. In the Monitoring the Future study, an annual NIDA-supported survey of the nation's middle school students, 8th graders regularly report the highest rate of current, past-year, and lifetime inhalant abuse compared to 10th and 12th graders. In 2010, 8 percent of 8th graders, 5.7 percent of 10th graders, and 3.6 percent of 12th graders reported abusing inhalants in the year prior to the survey.

One of the problems noted in the 2010 survey was 39 percent of 8th graders don't consider the regular use of inhalants to be harmful, and 64 percent don't think trying inhalants once or twice is risky. Young teens may not understand the risks of inhalant use as well as they should. 

Sniffing or snorting fumes from a container is the most common way inhalants are abused. Other times, fumes can be sprayed into a bag and inhaled (bagging) or practiced by huffing from an inhalant-soaked cloth. According to the NIDA, the high from inhalants only lasts a few minutes so individuals will maintain their high by repeatedly inhaling the fumes over several hours.  -->

> Yes and no. 

>Yes, there is currently violence in border states (California and Texas especially) related to cartel activity. There are many street gangs both American and Mexican (and South American) originated. These gangs and group that are responsible for moving, breaking down, and selling the drugs, and the groups who launder the money, etc often attract and perpetuate violence as a fact of life and way of doing business. Just as most things are this is amplified in correctional institutions. The violence in prisons do to gang ties, beef carried over from the streets, snitching can be a by-product of cartel business and connection.

<!-- 
No, because in America the justice system is not majority owned by the cartels where as in Mexico much of the political and justice system is susceptible to corruption and bribes. Also in Mexico the police wear masks and cartel "outlaws" have no fear of the law. Police and their family are subject to killing at the cartels say-so for something as simple as doing their job. This would not fly in America. There couldn't be mass killing of cops in the streets and huge amounts of corruption in law enforcement. I'm not saying it couldn't happen on a limited scale but not like Mexico. -->
