# Radio listening report

It is not a daily affeir for an urban settler to listen to radio, well, at least I think so. With the development of mobile Internet, people tend to look for entertainment form the Internet, for example, some kind of short videos. Radio is only listened in special occasions, like when you are driving a car or you are on a taxi then you have to listen to tarfic radios. Thus personally, I do not think that radio or broadcast is fasninating enough compared with online videos, for they not only provide audios but also videos which is much more atttention drawing. 

I choose to listen to a voa news broadcast about Trump. This news radio talked about Trump claiming to help ZhongXing, a Chinese telecom company recently senctioned by the U.S. government to go back to the right track. He said (on Twitter, of course) that the senction has made many people out of work which is a result that he do not willing to see. The radio also mentioned that the Chinese government appreciated his position.

This radio is organized like a trational news report. About one third of the content is about the news itself, and the other two third is about the background of this news, such as the America first policy and the potential influence of the tradewar between America and China.
