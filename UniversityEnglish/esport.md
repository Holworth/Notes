One year ago, the word 'eSport' had no real significance. A culture of hardcore video game players existed, but they were just that -- people with a serious interest in playing video games for pleasure. Seemingly out of nowhere, the eSports industry started to be taken seriously . Mega-agency WME | IMG is representing professional eSports players and teams. Marketing and media agency rEvolution has made acquisitions in the space and created a new eSports consulting subsidiary rEvXP. Now, award-winning global engagement marketing agency GMR is getting involved in the eSports space with the announcement that it has launched its own eSports consulting practice.

"You look at 35 million eSports fans in the U.S. and a 16-34 highly coveted demographic. Higher viewership for a global eSports tournament than sports that are so sacred in the U.S. is very eye opening," said Hill.

A SuperData brief from May 2015 indicates that the global eSports market is worth $612 million and its audience is 134 million and growing. Per Eventbrite, 67% of eSports players crave an increase in events with 40% indicating an interest in live events outside of major cities and 38% demonstrating a willingness to travel to another country or continent for an eSports tournament.

Canada-based Cineplex entered into a deal in September that causes it to pay $10 million to acquire WorldGaming's operational assets. WorldGaming is an eSports platform that promotes tournaments, leagues and gaming ladders. Cineplex plans on integrating eSports tournaments into its existing movie theaters.

Investment in the industry is largely driven by partnerships with other sports properties and leagues. Teams like the Miami Heat, Manchester City, West Ham, and the Philadelphia 76ers are investing in players and teams in the eSports space. It gives opportunities for more growth and fan base development while also creating new and appealing assets to sell to current and future corporate partners.

Twitch and YouTube only add value to the industry as more stakeholders and events emerge, thus making broadcasting and streaming tournaments and competitions all the more in demand in this growing industry.

### 1. Introduction

Is has not been so many years since the word *e-sports* came into the eyes of general public, and this word had been long considered to be equal to simply game playing. People who are not concerned about e-sports may find it difficult to understand why so many people are boosting e-sports now and hard to believe that many people can live by their jobs about e-sports. Yet the industrial of e-sports has been on its track since 1998 in Korea, and it is blooming faster and faster with the help of the Mobile Internet.

In old days, people underlooked esport's future because at that time, esports depend heavily on their sponsers. These sponsers are often giant companies and the money ther paid on esports were only a small amount of money, compared with the vast cost for their advertising. In recent days, however, esports are becoming more and more like traditional sporting events, in which the organizer of the game benefits both from the audiences and the advertisement publishers, which lead to the effect that more and more investers are becoming interested in esports.

In this passage, we will discuss about how esports runs, how its all involvers get benefit from it, and what will esports be like in the future. Perhaps, it will reveal the answer to the question: why the word "esports" are so popular now.

As this picture shows, the industry of esports has become a closed cycle, and everyone in the cycle gets benefits from the industrial, though people in different position of the picture may have different kinds of benefits. Besides this, this picture is also a panoramic picture for esports, which shows how a esport event is organized.

#### Organizers

An esport event starts from a organizer. Organizers prepare match field and invite players or teams to join the match. Usually, the organizers draw players by providing promising awards. The organizer then cast the match on TV, on Live-streaming platform, or on traditional video websites, and get reward from the audience and the advertisement providers.

The identities of the organzers are varied. Take China for instance. In the past, the organizers may be millionares who are in fancy with games, companies which want to advertise for their products in a different way, or game firm that want to sell more copies by holding competitions to draw people's attention. There were also companies focus on providing esports related things and organizing contests, but most of those companies lead a difficult life.

Things changed because of the development of technology. The Mobile Internet and the fast growing of live-streaming lead esports int to the sight of everyone. At this time, with the accmulation in the past years, even a grandmother aged woman in the supermarket can tell what esports is, that is to say, esports is becoming acknowledged by the society, then came the spring of esports. The investers find the market hide behind the enourmous number of people who care about esports, and set foot into this area. The professional gamers, the team, the organize companies both benefited from the capital surging into this area.

* todo: influence of capital.

With the surging money from the capital market, the players in this field has changed greatly. Game manufacturers now regard esports not only an advertisement for their games, but a new source for income, and a boost for the company on share market. (Blizard, for instance)

#### Professioal esports players, teams and leagues

##### How can a professional esports players make his live on esports.

Professional players can get income from the rewards for the match. Usually, matches provide high award for the champion of the game, and much lesser for the others, which makes the champion for a match really attractive. Except several special events, like exhibitional games for Olympic games, the easiest way to judge the level of a match is the amount of rewards it provides. High awards attracts high level players, and that makes the game more appreciation-worthy.

Besides awards from the match, some players can also get income by selling goods to their fans online. Also, live-streaming their first person perspective can win gifts from their fans and contract from live-streaming platform. In China, this two ways offers much more income the match awards for famous players.

Yet this lead to a problem. When a player spend too much time on live-streaming or managing his online store, it will undoubtly has a negative effect on his competition skills, and that is the paradox: the temptation of money for players do sometimes hindered the audience to see more splendid match. After all, when you can simply can money from talking with the audience and playing freely, few people will choose to train 12 or more hours for less money.

* todo: retired players. in "future" part

##### What's the relationship between players, teams and leagues.

* todo: "teams" have different meaning for different games, while "league" is almost the same as the leagues in traditional sports.

#### Casters

* Live-streaming

The newest and the most widely used way of watch a game. And also the easiest way to follow an esports star.

#### Audiences

<!-- ### The industrial circle -->

<!-- game manufacturer -->

How audiences support the esports system. //todo

* Buy tickets.
* Online shopping.
* Watch advertisements.
* Buy virtual items. (Dota2, for instance)

### 3. Analyzation: what will esport be like in the future

> Main part of the article.

> Maybe it is better to part it as an independent article? There are too much to discuss. 
* closer and closer to traditional sports
* how retired players make their lives (live-streaming, setup companies, become exers)
* how will the change of game influence the match, how long can a game survive (SC, 1998-now, for ex.)
* potential market (use TI reward curve)

### 4. Conclusion

To surmmrize, we can see that esports has become an industrial just alike traditional professional sports, which is proved to be a feasible way to run. What makes esports more promising than trditional sports is that the market is, unlike traditional professional sports domained by giants like NFL, MLB and NBA, still a piece of virgin land. The industrial is still in its upraising phase now, and the market has not yet solidized. Therefore, along with the growing attention people paid to esports and the decline of people's prejudge of esports, esports is still a valuable lore waiting to be mined.
