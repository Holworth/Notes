> Muslim’s are terrorist? Instead of saying, “You insane Trump supporter!” look at the fear clearly speaking out. What might you say to show empathy (i.e. non-judgement recognition of another’s emotions)? Is it necessary for you to state your position or would it be more worthy of your time to try to understand the other person’s fears?

> People don’t need to eat animals! What emotion is driving this statement? My guess is sadness. It could be anger, but often it’s sadness. Instead of arguing about whether human’s were made to eat animal protein or drink milk from non-human species, perhaps be curious about the sadness the person is experiencing.

> Men are horrible! Hopefully by now you can easily spot the emotion behind this statement. I would guess anger (and since I wrote it, I can confirm I’m right!). Will you decide to disagree and say how it’s women who are horrible or will you try to understand why this guy is so angry with men?

# Conclusion

> The best way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

Believe me is an ordinary expression used most often to assure people that what you're saying is credible, i.e., "You can trust me on this, right?"

Trump has been questioned throughout his presidential campaign and first term, so it's not very surprising that he tacks on this phrase on, just to hit it home that he is a reliable source of information . . . even if you are reading that information on Twitter.

Stupid
This is a pejorative term that is meant as an insult—no other way to spin it. It's a real hard-hitter, and Trump has proven that he's not shy of hard-hitting.

However, we hope this is a word he uses less of in his second year, it's better to build 'em up rather than to knock em' down.

This is another one that carries a lot of weight, especially if a person of power uses it. Trump has used the term a lot, describing everyone from Cher to terrorists as losers.

There are two schools of thought here. One might suggest this approach is an indiscriminate use of the term, which may make its effect less serious. On the other hand, carpet-bombing your foes with this insult may be the path of least resistance that provides the highest return: a reaction.

We/They
Using these terms frequently is a way of choosing sides. It's "us" versus "them." We're the "good guys," and they're the "bad guys." Creating sides starts conversation and debate, and maybe that's the silver lining of the we/they conundrum. Complicity no more?

Then again, sometimes Trump just uses we all by its lonesome (Twitter never forgets). Mysterious . . . .



Fire and fury
President Donald Trump has been known to make some controversial remarks once in awhile. One that definitely got people's attention was this quote from August 8, 2017: "North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen."

We define fire as a "a destructive conflagration," and fury as "unrestrained or violent anger, rage, passion, or the like." So, fire and fury used together in this context is indeed a very pointed threat. Back to the hard-hitting with this phrase .



Great is a commonly used term to denote something that is really good, really outstanding. Example: "I will build a great, great wall on our southern border." And, who can forget "Make America great again!"

We sure can't and neither can most television shows, comedians, article headlines, news reports.


The WashingtonTimes.com notes that "Donald never met a superlative he didn’t like," and that's right on the button. Incredible has to be right at the top.

There’s really nothing bad about a superlative here and there. However, when you overuse them, it gets harder and harder to differentiate between that which is truly incredible and what is merely average. There's another interesting usage of this word that Trump likes, as well . . . click ahead to see more.

With this phrase, Trump put away his fire and fury and is instead firing positive compliments. According to CNN, "if Trump is talking about incredible people, he is most likely talking about the military or law enforcement."

CNN is correct. "There is no single place I'd rather begin my trip than right here with all of you, the incredible men and women of the United States military.” And, we must say, it is a positive and notable thing to see respect given to such hardworking men and women.

Of course, the term is now commonly used to describe some type of disinformation that is disseminated. Trump claims he invented the term, which The Washington Post says is untrue.

But, what the heck, we're adding it anyway, because even if Trump didn't coin it, he definitely put it on the map.

Just last week, the president surprised some senior aides by announcing tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent on imports of steel and aluminum, respectively. While not shocking in terms of ideology — Trump has been vocally protectionist for decades — he short-circuited the process for announcing such a major policy. Senior aides told reporters no announcement was imminent. The White House was unable to give details of the proposal, because there none had cleared the complex legal and interagency process that typically precedes a rollout. Lawmakers allied with the administration but caught unawares reached out to reporters for any scraps of information about a decision that, critics warn, could trigger a trade war.

WASHINGTON — Amid unusually high staff turnover, confusion over major policies, and unexpected salvos from the tweeter-in-chief, President Trump on Tuesday portrayed the White House as a dream place to work but admitted: “I like conflict.”

“It’s tough, I like conflict, I like having two people with different points of view – and I certainly have that – and then I make a decision,” he said at a joint press conference with visiting Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven. “But I like watching it, I like seeing it, and I think it’s the best way to go.”

Earlier in the day, Trump had denied that his West Wing was in “chaos,” but cryptically added “I still have some people that I want to change.” That poured fuel on speculation that he could part ways with troubled Cabinet officials, like Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin or Attorney General Jeff Sessions, or senior aides like national security advisor H.R. McMaster and chief of staff John Kelly.

Asked at the press conference whether his comment might have referred to Sessions, Trump told reporters “I don’t really want to talk about that” before going on an extended riff praising his own West Wing.

“The White House has tremendous energy, it has tremendous spirit. It is a great place to be working. Many, many people want every single job,” he said.

“You know, I read where, ‘Oh, gee, maybe people don’t want to work for Trump.’ And believe me, everyone wants to work in the White House,” Trump declared. “They all want a piece of that Oval Office they want a piece of the West Wing. Not only in terms of it looks great on their résumé, it’s just a great place to work.”

But he again alluded to possible staffing changes.

“There’ll be people — I’m not going to be specific — but there’ll be people that change,” he said. “Sometimes they want to go out and do something else. But they all want to be in the White House. So many people want to come in. I have a choice of anybody. I could take any position in the West Wing and I’ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position.”

In fact, however, the administration has approached Republicans in Congress, at trade associations and think tanks, and in the private sector for various executive branch jobs, only to be rebuffed, according to people who have turned down White House overtures.

And the Trump administration has been slow to nominate candidates to fill important positions — of 638 key positions requiring Senate confirmation, 218 have no nominee, according to the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. (To the delight of conservatives, judges have been the exception).

Trump has seen remarkable turnover. According to data from a Brookings Institution report cited by the New York Times, the turnover rate of Trump’s staff in his first year — 34 percent — was higher than any White House in decades. He is on his second national security adviser – his third if you count a placeholder early last year – his second chief of staff, and will be hiring his fifth communications director after the sudden resignation of Hope Hicks.

Former chief of staff Reince Priebus says in an upcoming book that the chaos looks worse from inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

“Take everything you’ve heard and multiply it by 50,” Priebus says, according to an excerpt from the book published last month.

Trump’s efforts to deny that his administration is particularly volatile are also nothing new. After a string of departures last year – press secretary Sean Spicer, Priebus, and blink-and-you-missed-his-tenure communications director Anthony Scaramucci — Trump took to Twitter.

His message? “No WH chaos!”
